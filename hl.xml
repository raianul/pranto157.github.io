death is dramatically higher for people with opioid addictions, but researchers
have found that some simple measures may reduce that risk. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2017/06/27.html" target="_blank">new
study</a> from the RAND Corporation concluded that
following three aspects of care led to a decrease in mortality by one-third.</p>

<p>The trio of
treatments include quarterly physician visits, psychosocial counseling, and not
prescribing benzodiazepines or opiates.</p>

<p>The
one-third reduction is significant because it applies to people with opioid
addictions, even if they are not actively seeking treatment.</p>

<p>?Even though
treatment is really important, specifically medication assisted treatment,
there are many people with opioid use disorders who don?t want treatment,? Dr.
Katherine Watkins, a board-certified practicing psychiatrist, and lead author
of the RAND study, told Healthline.</p>


<h2>What works, what doesn?t</h2>

<p>This
research drew on a cohort of 32,422 individuals in the Veterans Affairs healthcare
system from 2006 and 2007. </p>

<p>Watkins and
her team studied seven major healthcare factors to examine what the effects
would be on the mortality rate in people with opioid addictions.</p>

<p>The factors
that assisted treatment included HIV screening, hepatitis screening, and
medication.</p>

<p>But researchers
concluded these therapies were not relevant in reducing mortality.</p>

<p>However, a
third element, refraining from prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines, proved
more complicated. </p>

<p>Watkins
cautioned that both of these drugs, especially when used in tandem, could be fatal
because they depress breathing and other basic functions of the central nervous
system. </p>

<p>Benzodiazepines
are commonly used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. However, like opioids,
they are also sedatives.</p>

<p>Prescribing
and re-prescribing opioids to someone dealing with opioid addiction is common
and presents a unique dilemma for the healthcare community.</p>

<p><a href="/health-news/best-way-to-treat-people-addicted-to-opioids#2">Healthline reported</a> earlier this year on a study that concluded, ?Approximately
two-fifths (43 percent) of buprenorphine recipients filled an opioid
prescription during the treatment episode, and two-thirds (67 percent) filled
an opioid prescription following treatment.?</p>

<p>What this
means is that even those in treatment for opioid addiction have a high
likelihood of being prescribed these drugs anyway.</p>

<p>?Be really
careful of these medications,? said Watkins. ?We prescribe a lot of opioids for
pain and sometimes opioids are really important for some people who have acute
pain, but they are not good in people with chronic pain, and sometimes we
prescribe too many in people with acute pain.?</p>



<h2>Drug-assisted treatments</h2>

<p>This study
did not establish a link between medication-assisted opioid addiction treatment
?methadone, for example ? and lower mortality rates. </p>

<p>?We know
from other research that medication-assisted therapy can help people stay off
drugs, get jobs, and lead more productive lives,? Watkins wrote in a press
release. ?But in this study, the treatment strategy was not associated with
lower mortality.?</p>

<p>The reason,
Watkins explained, is that while treatment tends to lower mortality rates in
the long run for addicts, going on and off treatment are both linked with an
increased risk of death.</p>

<p>That finding
is confirmed in a study from the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1550" target="_blank">BMJ</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>?Probably
the worst thing you could do is start and stop, start and stop, which is
probably typical of what actually happens [during treatment],? said Watkins. ?That?s
really dangerous.?</p>

<p>However,
this research should be encouraging to those dealing with opioid addiction,
even if they elect not to pursue treatment, because it clearly identifies three
steps users can take to become safer.</p>

<p>?If you know
someone who is addicted to opioids, encourage them to get regular checkups with
their doctor, even if they are not interested in treatment,? said Watkins.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-27T15:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-27T15:00:00</updateddate><category>Addiction</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/simple-ways-to-treat-opioid-addictions</guid><dc:date>2017-06-27T15:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Does Marijuana Increase the Risk of Vehicle Crashes?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-marijuana-increase-risk-of-vehicle-crashes </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Last month a high school senior in Ohio drove
off the road on the way home from prom, striking two utility poles and killing
his passenger, 17-year-old Lindsey Rotuno.</p>

<p>The Ohio Highway Patrol eventually <a href="http://www.chroniclet.com/cops-and-courts/2017/06/23/Highway-patrol-Driver-in-Midview-prom-night-crash-had-marijuana-in-his-system.html" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that driver Chase Johnson, 18,
had marijuana in his system. Rotuno was not wearing a seatbelt.</p>

<p>Police are still investigating the crash, and
the Lorain County prosecutor?s office has yet to determine if Johnson will face
charges.</p>

<p>But some opponents of marijuana legalization
are concerned that these types of crashes will only increase as more U.S.
states relax restrictions on marijuana use.</p>

<p>While decades of research have shown that
alcohol increases the risk of vehicle crashes, marijuana research is mixed. Still,
it?s clear enough that some researchers urge caution.</p>

<p>?Alcohol is still the main contributor to
[vehicle crash] risk. It doesn?t mean that marijuana or cannabis don?t
contribute. To me, it?s very clear that if you are stoned, you are at risk. You
shouldn?t drive at all,? Eduardo Romano, PhD, a senior research scientist at
the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, told Healthline.</p>


<p><strong><a href="/health-news/policy-experts-debate-marijuana-legalization-010613">Read more:
The experts weigh in on marijuana legalization </a></strong></p>

<h2>Increase in drivers using marijuana</h2>

<p>Currently, eight U.S. states and the District
of Columbia have legalized adult-use <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx" target="_blank">recreational
marijuana</a>.
Twenty-nine states and D.C. have legalized <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank">medicinal
marijuana</a>.</p>

<p>Between 2007 and 2014, the percentage of
drivers in the United States who tested positive for THC ? the main
psychoactive chemical in cannabis ? increased from 8.6 percent to 12.6 percent,
according to a <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/11388b-roadsidesurvey-execsummary.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>

<p>Another NHTSA <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/812307-tt-marijuana_use_in_wa.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> found a similar increase in
THC-positive drivers in the state of Washington after marijuana for recreational
use was legalized in July 2014.</p>

<p>However, the only statistically significant
change was in the percentage of drivers who tested positive for marijuana
during the daytime ? increasing from 7.8 percent just before the law went into
effect, to 18.9 percent one year later.</p>

<p>Marijuana and alcohol were the most common
substances in drivers? systems. Drivers who tested positive for alcohol ranged
from 4.4 percent to 6 percent.</p>

<p>The Washington State study used different
methods than the countrywide study, so it?s not possible to directly compare
the results.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/legalizing-recreational-marijuana-is-linked-to-increased-crashes" target="_blank">study</a> by the Highway Loss Data
Institute also estimated that vehicle collisions are about 3 percent higher in
Colorado, Oregon, and Washington than if these states hadn?t legalized
marijuana.</p>

<p>The study, though, cannot tell whether the
increase in crashes is directly caused by drivers who were high.</p>

<p>But another <a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2016/05/fatal-road-crashes-involving-marijuana-double-state-legalizes-drug/" target="_blank">study</a> last year found that fatal
vehicle crashes involving people who?d recently used marijuana before driving doubled
after Washington State legalized the drug.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers from the AAA
Foundation for Traffic Safety looked at crash records and drug tests done on
the drivers.</p>

<p>However, even with the results of this study,
researchers did not know when the driver had last used marijuana or if they
were impaired by it.</p>


<p><strong><a href="/health-news/do-medical-marijuana-laws-increase-misuse">Read more: Do medical marijuana laws encourage adults to misuse the drug? </a></strong></p>

<h2>Mixed
marijuana research</h2>

<p>Although marijuana research is mixed, it
points toward some effect of the drug on driving ability and crash risk.</p>

<p>?The evidence [for marijuana] is leaning
toward something going on. But even with the studies that show an increased
risk of crash involvement, the effect sizes are relatively low to moderate,?
Mark Johnson, PhD, center director and senior research scientist at the Pacific
Institute for Research and Evaluation, told Healthline.</p>

<p>Certain types of studies are more consistent.</p>

<p>?Experimental lab studies show with somewhat
consistency that dosing people with cannabis does appear to impair performance
on driving-related skills,? said Johnson. </p>

<p>In driving simulator <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836260/" target="_blank">experiments</a>, marijuana increased drivers?
reaction times.</p>

<p>Also, drivers who had used marijuana
displayed increased following distance and lane weaving.</p>

<p>The size of the effects varied from study to
study, and depended on the THC dose and whether the drivers regularly used
marijuana.</p>

<p>But does this translate to the real world?</p>

<p>?Just because you have a slow reaction time
on some test, or you deviate within your lane 3 centimeters more than normal,
it?s hard to say to what extent that means you?re more likely to crash,? said
Johnson. ?It says something, but it?s hard to piece it all together.?</p>

<p>With studies that look at actual crashes and
whether marijuana was a contributing factor, ?there?s a lot more
inconsistency,? said Johnson.</p>

<p>A 2012 <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e536" target="_blank">review</a> in the BMJ of nine previous studies found that use of cannabis
almost doubled the risk of a vehicle crash ? although this increase ranged from
35 to 173 percent. Risk also varied based on the type of study and whether researchers
looked at fatal or nonfatal crashes.</p>

<p>A later 2016 <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.13347/abstract" target="_blank">re-review</a> of the same nine studies,
published in the journal Addiction,
estimated that cannabis increased the risk of a crash by 10 to 61 percent ?
what the researchers called a ?low to medium? increase.</p>

<p>In this later study, researchers took into
account factors that affect marijuana use. For example, young adults and males
are more likely to drive under the influence of marijuana. </p>

<p>In comparison, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5408372/?reload=true" target="_blank">alcohol</a> has larger ? and more consistent
? effects on driving performance and crash risk.</p>

<p>But that doesn?t mean something isn?t going
on with marijuana.</p>

<p>?I?m not trying to say that cannabis doesn?t
impair performance,? said Johnson. ?It may actually contribute to crash risk,
but if it does, they are certainly smaller effects than alcohol, and there?s
just more uncertainty about it.?</p>

<h2>Marijuana
affects people differently</h2>

<p>Scientists have had a hard time pinning down
the effects of marijuana on driving and vehicle crashes for many reasons.</p>

<p>?It?s very difficult to disentangle all these
nuances and separate the contribution of marijuana from other effects,? said
Romano. ?So that?s why some of the inconsistencies are there.?</p>

<p>Romano speculates that marijuana may
contribute more to certain types of crashes. Lumping these together can
contribute to the mixed results.</p>

<p>Also, while alcohol has a strong effect on
driving skills in general, marijuana may depend on the situation.</p>

<p>?Alcohol and cannabis tend to affect
different types of skills,? said Johnson. ?Some driving-related skills are more
sensitive to alcohol. Others are more sensitive to cannabis.?</p>

<p>For example, a driver who knows they are high
may slow down when they see someone crossing the road. But if the pedestrian
stops in the road suddenly, the driver?s slower reaction time may not be enough
to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21049267" target="_blank">study</a> also showed that heavy cannabis
users can develop tolerance to some of the effects of THC. At the same time,
these people didn?t develop tolerance to the effects of alcohol from using
marijuana.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, though ? alcohol and
cannabis are not a good combination.</p>

<p>?The combination is really lethal,? said
Romano.</p>


<p><strong><a href="/health-news/if-marijuana-is-a-medicine-why-cant-we-buy-it-in-pharmacies-041015">Read more: If marijuana is medicine,
why can?t we buy it in pharmacies? </a></strong></p>

<h2>No
field sobriety test for marijuana</h2>

<p>The different effects that marijuana has on
different people also makes it difficult for police officers to know if someone
is impaired by the drug. </p>

<p>Roadside tests used to see if someone is
under the influence of alcohol ? like heel-toe walking, following a pen with
the eyes, or standing on one leg while counting ? may not catch everyone who is
impaired by marijuana. </p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3456923/" target="_blank">study</a> suggests that the Standardized
Field Sobriety test identifies only about 30 percent of people who are high,
but 88 percent of people who are drunk.</p>

<p>Police can determine a driver?s THC level
from blood or urine samples. These tests, though, are often done hours later,
which may not match the driving level.</p>

<p>Tests using saliva are also available, but
are less accurate than blood and urine tests. Scientists are working on new
saliva tests that produce better <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2100747-speedy-cannabis-spit-test-could-spot-people-driving-while-high/" target="_blank">results</a>.</p>

<p>Several states ? including Colorado and
Washington ? have threshold <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/drugged-driving-overview.aspx" target="_blank">limits</a> for THC ? similar to Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) limits. Drivers found over this limit are presumed to be
guilty of driving under the influence.</p>

<p>But even with a highly accurate, on-the-spot
test, a given THC level doesn?t always translate to driving impairment for
every driver.</p>

<p>?Let?s suppose you have 5 nanograms of THC,
is that impairment?? said Romano. ?The law may say it is impairing, but it
depends.?</p>

<p>Marijuana can be detected days or even weeks
after use, so THC levels don?t always show when a person used the drug, or if
the driver was impaired.</p>

<p>This differs sharply from alcohol, which is
supported by more consistent scientific studies.</p>

<p>?We know that the higher the BAC, the greater
the risk,? said Johnson, ?and we know that 0.08 percent [BAC] is certainly
associated with a much higher risk of crash involvement.?</p>

<p>The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety <a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2016/05/fatal-road-crashes-involving-marijuana-double-state-legalizes-drug/" target="_blank">recommends</a> that instead of an arbitrary
legal limit for THC, police officers should be trained to recognize
marijuana-impaired drivers. A recent positive marijuana test would be used only
to back this up.</p>


<p><strong><a href="/health-news/will-trump-crack-down-on-marijuana">Read more: Will
Trump administration crack down on marijuana laws? </a></strong></p>

<h2>Public
perceptions of driving high</h2>

<p>Because of the inconsistent scientific
research, ?it?s easy to pick out studies that support your view and just talk
about those,? said Johnson.</p>

<p>This may also fuel mixed public beliefs about
the dangers of marijuana and driving.</p>

<p>In a 2016 <a href="https://www.aaafoundation.org/hlcmsresource/TSCIDUIBeliefsAndBehaviorsFS.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> by the AAA Foundation for
Traffic Safety, 58 percent of more than 6,000 people thought that using
marijuana one hour before driving increased the risk of a crash, while 32
percent didn?t know.</p>

<p>Another <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146853" target="_blank">survey</a> that year of 865 marijuana users
in Colorado and Washington, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that 44 percent of people had driven while high
in the past year. Almost 24 percent had used marijuana within an hour of
driving five or more times in the past month.</p>

<p>On the flip side, those who thought driving
while high is unsafe were less likely to do it. Familiarity with the marijuana
DUI laws, though, had no effect on whether people admitted to driving while
high.</p>

<p>The researchers suggest that public education
programs that focus on the risks of using marijuana while driving may be more
effective than telling people about the laws.</p>

<p>One poster from Colorado?s Drugged Driving <a href="https://www.codot.gov/safety/alcohol-and-impaired-driving/druggeddriving/campaign-materials.html" target="_blank">campaign</a> takes this approach. It features
a totaled car that resembles a smoldering joint, with the caption ?Hits lead to
hits. Don?t drive high.?</p>

<p>Canada?s Pot and Driving <a href="http://www.cpha.ca/uploads/progs/_/pot/poster_e.pdf" target="_blank">campaign</a> has a poster that shows two
pilots lighting a joint in an airplane cockpit. The caption: ?If it doesn?t
make sense here, why does it make sense when you drive??</p>

<p>These campaigns are all about passing on a
simple message, in spite of the confusing science.</p>

<p>?The only thing that is consistent is that
alcohol is riskier than marijuana, but that doesn?t mean marijuana is not,?
said Romano. ?So to me, don?t smoke and drive.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-27T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-27T14:00:00</updateddate><category>Public Policy</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-marijuana-increase-risk-of-vehicle-crashes</guid><dc:date>2017-06-27T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Is the Rheumatology Field Running Out of Doctors?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-the-rheumatology-field-running-out-of-doctors </link><description><![CDATA[<p>When
you get sick, you go to the doctor.</p>

<p>But
what happens when there?s no doctor to go to?</p>

<p>The
number of doctors specializing in rheumatology is starting to dwindle.</p>

<p>As
a result, these specialists ? especially pediatric rheumatologists ? are in high
demand. </p>

<p>To
combat this trend, organizations like the Rheumatology Research Foundation, the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the Arthritis Foundation, and others,
are trying to pique the interest of medical students and attract new doctors to
the field. </p>

<p>Rheumatologists ?
doctors who specialize in autoimmune conditions ? are of vital importance to people with diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), lupus, and osteoporosis.</p>

<p>But rheumatology
as a field doesn?t seem to be attracting enough new doctors to treat an
ever-expanding group of patients. </p>

<p>An
estimated 25 percent of adults in the Unites States have arthritis, and 1.5
million of them have RA. Additionally, there are more than 100 known unique
rheumatic diseases.</p>

<p>However,
there are few specialists available to treat these patients. There are only 1.7
rheumatologists per 100,000 people in the United States. </p>



<h2>A need to meet a
growing demand</h2>

<p>A
nonprofit called the Rheumatology Research Foundation is trying to lure medical
students into rheumatology by offering them scholarships. </p>

<p>?Arthritis
and other musculoskeletal problems are the number one cause of disability in
America,? Foundation officials wrote in a recent press release. </p>

<p>Additionally,
arthritis and other rheumatic diseases result higher medical costs than cancer,
according to the foundation. They estimated that in the United States each year
at least $127 billion is spent on medical costs related to rheumatic conditions
compared with $104 billion in medical costs for cancer care.</p>

<p>?The
shortage of doctors, especially rheumatologists, is a concern that drastically
impacts the lives of people diagnosed with rheumatic disease,? said Mary
Wheatley, IOM, CAE, the Foundation?s executive director. ?Many patients must
wait months to see a rheumatologist, which prolongs treatment and has a
negative impact on their health. Not to mention the impact that missed days at
work and the cost of disability insurance has on the economy.? </p>

<p>Living
in a rural or less-populated area can make finding a specialist difficult. In
2013, the American College of Rheumatology published a <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-109897.html" target="_blank">study</a>
that found there may be no rheumatologists in some of these areas, causing
patients to drive 200 or more miles to see a rheumatology specialist. </p>

<p>A
2007 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17328042" target="_blank">study</a>,
also done by the ACR, concluded that demand for rheumatologists would likely
exceed the number of practicing specialists in the coming decades, and that new
strategies should be utilized to ?adapt to this changing healthcare landscape.?
</p>

<p>The
ACR also noted that strategies ?include increasing the number of fellows each
year, utilizing physician assistants and nurse practitioners in greater
numbers, and improving practice efficiency.? </p>

<p>To
help untreated patients, the ACR has focused on patient registries and
developed a consortium of rheumatologists to try to figure out how to provide better
and more accessible care for people. </p>

<p>The
ACR?s recent <a href="http://simpletasks.org/trouble-finding-a-rheumatologist/" target="_blank">workforce study</a>, like the 2007 study, showed that demand for adult rheumatology care
exceeded supply; In 2015 it was 36 percent. Researchers expect that by the year
2025, approximately 3,800 more rheumatologists will be needed to meet patient
demand.</p>



<h2>Group taking
action</h2>

<p>The
Arthritis Foundation is taking it a step further, using advocacy and going to
Capitol Hill to make an impact when it comes to a specific type of rheumatoid
arthritis ? juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, now known as juvenile idiopathic
arthritis. </p>

<p>The
foundation is hoping to combat the serious pediatric rheumatology shortage.
Currently there are fewer than <a href="http://www.arthritis.org/Documents/Sections/Advocate/advocacy-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">350 board-certified pediatric rheumatologists</a> nationwide despite the fact there are nearly
300,000 juvenile arthritis patients.</p>

<p>In
2015, along with other groups, the foundation hosted a <a href="https://www.rheumatology.org/About-Us/Newsroom/Press-Releases/ID/682/Leading-Arthritis-Advocacy-Groups-Urge-Policymakers-to-Address-Nations-Pediatric-Arthritis-Specialist-Shortage" target="_blank">policy briefing</a> in Washington D.C. to explain to lawmakers that this shortage could
hurt patients. </p>

<p>In
an effort to help these young patients, more rheumatologists may start treating
people of all ages. </p>

<p>?I
know for me it was hard to find a good rheumatologist who I trusted when I
moved to West Virginia from Pittsburgh ? so I continued making the one-and-a-half
hours? drive back to my rheumatologist in Pittsburgh,? said patient Chelsea
Walker. ?There?s no pediatric rheumatologists around that I know of.? </p>

<p>In
addition to these steps, the ACR launched the <a href="https://www.rheumatology.org/Get-Involved/Simple-Tasks" target="_blank">Simple Tasks</a> campaign. This initiative is busily addressing the issue ? even going
so far as to attempt to educate and work with congressional representatives on
the topic. </p>

<p>They
are advocating for student loan forgiveness for rheumatology doctors, allowing
more international doctors to practice in the United States, and increase
residency slots. </p>

<p>They?ve
also formed a special committee to work on the topic in Congress, and are
supporting a new bill: <a href="http://simpletasks.org/trouble-finding-a-rheumatologist/" target="_blank">Conrad State 30 &amp; Physician Access Act</a>. The bill would keep premium visa processing for
international doctors, which would allow them stay in the United States after
finishing residencies, if they would agree to practice in rural or underserved
communities where rheumatologists are scarce.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-26T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-26T14:00:00</updateddate><category>Arthritis</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-the-rheumatology-field-running-out-of-doctors</guid><dc:date>2017-06-26T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Drinking Can Cause Your Cells to Age</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/drinking-can-cause-cells-to-age </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Drinking alcohol is widely accepted in
the Western world, but few people are probably aware of the damage that alcohol
can do on a biological level.</p>

<p>New research shows how drinking can
affect the health of our cells, causing them to age prematurely. </p>

<p>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism (NIAAA) <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcoholfacts&amp;stats/AlcoholFacts&amp;Stats.pdf" target="_blank">reports</a> that in the United
States, alcohol is the fourth leading preventable cause of death. Every year,
approximately 88,000 U.S. adults die from alcohol-related causes.</p>

<p>And yet, according to recent estimates, more
than half of U.S. individuals have drank in the past month and almost 27
percent of adults report binge drinking in the past month. </p>

<p>New research ? presented at the 40th
annual <a href="https://www.xcdsystem.com/rsoa/index.cfm" target="_blank">scientific
meeting</a> of the Research Society on
Alcoholism (RSA), held in Colorado ?
suggests that the more people drink, the older their cells get.</p>

<p>The findings were presented by Dr.
Naruhisa Yamaki, a clinical fellow at the Kobe University Graduate School of
Medicine in Japan.</p>

<p>The study focused on the effects of
alcohol on telomere length.</p>

<p>?Telomeres, the protein caps on the ends
of human chromosomes, are markers of aging and overall health,? explained Yamaki.
</p>

<p>Telomeres are repetitive segments of DNA
found at the end of chromosomes. As <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0029399/" target="_blank">explained</a>
in U.S. National Library of Medicine, their role is to protect the ends of
chromosomes, just like ?the tips of shoelaces keep them from unraveling.?</p>

<p>Every time a cell divides, telomeres lose
a part of their DNA. As we age, our telomeres get shorter and shorter, until
all of the DNA in the telomere is lost and the cells can no longer replicate, causing
them to die. </p>

<p>Some people, however, may have shorter
telomere length for other reasons than aging. This puts them <a href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/drinking-makes-you-older-at-the-cellular-level" target="_blank">at risk</a>
of illnesses that are normally associated with growing older, such as
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, and some forms of cancer. </p>



<h2>Shorter telomeres,
thiamine deficiency</h2>

<p>Yamaki and colleagues examined 255
people.</p>

<p>Some of them were enrolled in treatment
programs for alcoholism at the Kurihama National Hospital in Japan. </p>

<p>Of the study participants, 134 had
alcoholism and 121 did not. The participants? age ranged between 41 and 85
years old. </p>

<p>The researchers examined the drinking
patterns and drinking history of the participants, as well as collected DNA
samples from all of them. </p>

<p>?Our study showed that alcoholic
patients have a shortened telomere length, which means that heavy drinking
causes biological aging at a cellular level [...] It is alcohol rather than
acetaldehyde that is associated with a shortened telomere length,? said Yamaki.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetaldehyde#section=Top" target="_blank">Acetaldehyde</a>
is a toxic byproduct that occurs when the human body metabolizes alcohol. </p>

<p>The researchers also found that shorter
telomeres correlated with thiamine, or vitamin B-1, deficiency. </p>

<p><a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/thiamin" target="_blank">Thiamine</a> is a vitamin that the human body needs in order to
metabolize carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids.</p>

<p>A severe deficiency of thiamine can cause
a disease called ?beriberi? that affects several organs, and it can also lead
to neurological disorders such as Wernicke's
encephalopathy or the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. </p>

<p>Yamaki explains, ?Although how exactly TD [thiamine deficiency] can cause
neural impairments is unclear, it is well known that oxidation stress cause[s]
telomere shortening and, thus, it is possible that oxidation stress may also
cause neuron death.?</p>

<p>He also emphasizes the importance of the
findings for public health. People must know that heavy alcohol use and binge
drinking can lead to the premature shortening of the telomeres, Yamaki says,
because ?awareness of this fact provides important information necessary for
people to live healthier.?</p>

<p>The NIAAA <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcoholfacts&amp;stats/AlcoholFacts&amp;Stats.pdf" target="_blank">define</a> binge drinking
as consuming approximately five or more alcoholic drinks for men, and four or
more drinks for women, in one sitting.</p>

<p>Heavy alcohol use is defined as binge
drinking on five or more occasions in the past month.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-26T13:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-26T13:00:00</updateddate><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/drinking-can-cause-cells-to-age</guid><dc:date>2017-06-26T13:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Caregiver Mental Stress Can Shorten Dementia Patients? Lives</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/caregiver-mental-stress-shortens-dementia-patients-lives </link><description><![CDATA[<p>A study published this week in the
journal Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences finds that patients with dementia whose
caregivers are mentally stressed may die sooner.</p>

<p>Currently, more than 7 million people in the United States live with a
neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<p>These conditions include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's
disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Patients often live for three to 10 years after a diagnosis, depending
on the condition and its severity.</p>

<p>During this time, it is typically a family member who cares for the
individual as they begin to lose emotional, motor, and cognitive functioning.</p>

<p>Because of the aging population and other factors, these types of
conditions are becoming <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280411/" target="_blank">more prevalent</a> in the U.S.
population.</p>

<p>Most research is centered on curing or treating these conditions.
However, over recent years more focus has been given to the health of
caregivers.</p>

<p>The latest study to investigate this relationship was carried out at the
University of California (UC), Berkeley.</p>



<h2>Caring for caregivers</h2>

<p>Senior author Robert Levenson, a psychology professor at UC Berkeley,
says, "Family members and others who provide critically needed care for
these patients do heroic and extremely challenging work.? </p>

<p>He adds, ?Soaring rates of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases
constitute one of the most pressing public health challenges of the present
era, and this will become even more challenging as the population ages."</p>

<p>The researchers followed 176 patients with neurodegenerative diseases
that steadily degrade brain function. They also measured the  mental health of
the people who took care of them: ?85 percent were spouses, 8 percent were
adult children, and 6 percent were siblings.?</p>

<p>The participants were all examined at the Berkeley Psychophysiology
Laboratory. Researchers gathered information about the caregivers? social and
emotional well-being during follow-up appointments and over the phone. </p>

<p>According to study co-lead author Sandy Lwi, "We were able to meet
and speak with a number of caregivers, many of whom talked about the challenges
of watching their spouse or loved one slowly lose their sense of self and their
ability to live independently."</p>

<p>Out of 176 participants, 76 died during the course of the study (2007 to
2016). Based on the length of time from their initial assessment to their time
of death (or the cut-off point in 2016), each participant's longevity was
measured.</p>

<p>Longevity decreased for patients whose caregivers had the poorest mental
health. This result remained significant even once the data had been adjusted
for other factors, such as patient age, gender, disease severity, and mental
health.</p>

<p>Overall, the patients whose caregivers had
poor mental health died <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2017-06/uoc--dpm062317.php" target="_blank">14
months</a> sooner than those with better mental health.</p>

<p>Caregivers are known to suffer psychologically. In fact, an estimated 40
percent of caregivers have <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/kc/depression-causes-symptoms-treatments-8933" target="_blank">depression</a>, and they often report
higher-than-average levels of social isolation, <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, and frustration.</p>

<p>Co-lead author Brett Ford says, "These findings
make a compelling case that helping preserve the mental health of caregivers
may also help the patients in their care."</p>



<h2>How patients are affected</h2>

<p>Although the results cannot prove cause and effect, according to
Levenson, the findings highlight "the mutual influence both parties'
mental and physical states have on one another, and the extraordinarily high
stakes that are involved."</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that the patient might be affected negatively
by the mental health of their caregiver.</p>

<p>For instance, the level of care might be reduced, which raises the
chances of abuse or neglect. Stress on social bonds may also weaken
the immune system. </p>

<p>Additionally, negative emotions might be passed between the two parties
by so-called emotional contagion, which occurs when one person ?absorbs the
emotional responses of the other.?</p>

<p>As the number of neurodegenerative disease cases rise ? with 8 million
U.S. adults estimated to be living with dementia by 2030 ? studies such as this
become ever more important.</p>

<p>The researchers plan to keep in touch with the surviving caregivers and
their patients over the coming years, ?to dig deeper into the dynamics?
involved.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-26T12:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-26T12:00:00</updateddate><category>Mental Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/caregiver-mental-stress-shortens-dementia-patients-lives</guid><dc:date>2017-06-26T12:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Why Liver Cancer Rates Continue to Increase</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/liver-cancer-rates-continue-increase </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Between 2009
and 2013, doctors diagnosed liver cancer in 7.7 people out of every 100,000.</p>

<p>That number
has been increasing since the mid-1970s.</p>

<p>In addition,
the death rate is rising faster than for any other cancer ? it is one of
America?s leading causes of cancer death. </p>

<p>Between 2010
and 2014, it stood at 6.3 people per 100,000.</p>

<p>The
five-year survival rate is only about 20 percent.</p>

<p>Healthline
spoke with <a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/find-providers/physician/jack-f-jacoub-md" target="_blank">Dr. Jack Jacoub</a>, medical
oncologist and director of thoracic oncology at MemorialCare Cancer Institute
at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California.</p>

<p>He stated
that liver cancer is ?the second most common cancer killer in the world.?</p>

<p>This month,
researchers at the American Cancer Society (ACS) published a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21402/full" target="_blank">groundbreaking study</a> in CA: A
Cancer Journal for Clinicians.</p>

<p>During the
study, researchers uncovered trends in liver cancer incidence, survival, and
mortality rates.</p>

<p>Researchers
used <a href="/health/body-mass-index">Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)</a> program data obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics.</p>



<h2>Risk factors</h2>

<p>The
following risk factors contribute to liver cancer:</p>

<ul><li><a href="/health/hepatitis">hepatitis</a> (caused by either the hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus)</li><li><a href="/health/type-2-diabetes">type
2 diabetes</a></li><li>metabolic disorders and <a href="/health/obesity">excess body
weight</a></li><li>alcohol consumption</li><li>tobacco smoking</li></ul>

<p><a href="http://california.providence.org/saint-johns/find-a-doctor/b/bilchik-anton/" target="_blank">Dr. Anton Bilchik</a>, professor
of surgery and chief of gastrointestinal research at John Wayne Cancer
Institute at Providence Saint John?s Health Center in California, also spoke
with Healthline.</p>

<p>Bilchik said
?the reason for the increase in primary liver cancer is largely related to the
obesity epidemic that we have going on in this country.?</p>

<p>?Whereas hepatitis
C used to be the most common cause of liver cancer, the most common cause now
is related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,? he noted.</p>

<p>Jacoub,
meanwhile, believes that hepatitis still poses the greatest risk. </p>

<p>?There is a
very big spiking in hepatitis C infection over the past few decades. And that
is the predominant risk factor in the United States for liver cancer,? he said.</p>

<p>Jacoub also suggested
another risk factor. He cautioned that ?anyone who has hereditary iron overload
symptoms,? such as hemochromatosis, is at risk.</p>

<p>?[This] iron
scenario causes iron overloading of the liver and [that] causes inflammation
and scarring and then ? <a href="/health/cirrhosis#development2">cirrhosis</a>,? he said.</p>

<p>?Whenever
cirrhosis develops, you?re immediately at risk for liver cancer,? Jacoub
explained.</p>


<h2>The influx of hepatitis C</h2>

<p>?The
incidence of hepatitis C in the baby boomer population [those born between 1945
and 1965] is as high as 2 to 3 percent,? reported Bilchik. ?And it?s been
recommended that all baby boomers should be at least checked for hepatitis C,
particularly since recently we [now] have drugs that are very effective at
curing patients of hepatitis C.?</p>

<p>Bilchik added,
?The biggest breakthrough in this field has been the fact that relatively
nontoxic antiviral medications are now FDA-approved that can eradicate hepatitis
C.?</p>

<p>?The
problem,? he said, ?is that a very small percentage of baby boomers are being
tested, or have been tested.? </p>

<p>Hepatitis B
infection is also preventable. And there is an effective vaccine. </p>

<p>Starting in
1982, hepatitis B vaccinations became a part of routine childhood vaccinations.</p>

<p>As a result,
in 2015 the vaccination rate among younger people varied from a low of 83
percent in Idaho, to a high of 98 percent in New Hampshire. </p>

<p>However, only
50 percent of older adults in the United States have been vaccinated.</p>



<h2>The risk associated with weight</h2>

<p>Studies show
that liver cancer risk increases by 26 percent for every five point increase in
one?s <a href="/health/body-mass-index">Body Mass Index (BMI)</a>.</p>

<p>More men
than women are overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9.) However, a greater number of women
fall into the categories of obese (BMI 30-39.9), and class 3 obese (BMI 40+).</p>

<p>Bilchik
noted, ?Non-insulin dependent diabetes and lack of physical activity are often
associated and linked to obesity.?</p>

<p>In the
United States, 69 percent of adults over age 20 are overweight.</p>

<p>?It?s well
known that up to 25 percent of kids, if not more, are overweight, if not
obese,? stated Bilchik.</p>

<p>Indications
are that greater weight control intervention can help, especially among
children.</p>

<p>Interventions
might help reduce obesity levels, type 2 diabetes, and ultimately liver cancer
rates.</p>


<h2>Alcohol, tobacco risk factors</h2>

<p>Regardless
of amount, drinking alcohol increases your risk of liver cancer.</p>

<p>?Not just in
alcoholics,? Bilchik noted, ?but also in those people that are considered binge
drinkers.?</p>

<p>More effort
put into alcohol abuse prevention programs may prove beneficial.</p>

<p>Smokers have
a higher risk for liver cancer, too.</p>

<p>Tobacco
users increase their risk of liver cancer by approximately 50 percent.</p>


<h2>Race, ethnicity make a difference</h2>

<p>There are
now treatments for hepatitis C, vaccines for hepatitis B, and better public
education about the risks of obesity.</p>

<p>As such, one
might expect liver cancer rates to be falling.</p>

<p>But they?re
not.</p>

<p>Until the
publication of the ACS study, it was difficult to find information that
explored total liver cancer mortality and survival rates in the United States.</p>

<p>This was
also true for liver cancer mortality and survival rates with regard to race and
ethnicity.</p>

<p>Regarding
the study, Jacoub noted ?liver cancer is one of the few cancers that really has
extremely dramatic ethnic variations in population variations. And you?re
seeing it in this report.?</p>

<p>The
researchers found that the death rate for liver cancer in non-Hispanic whites
was 5.5 per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>That
compared with 8.4 per 100,000 for blacks, 11.9 per 100,000 for American
Indians/Alaska Natives, 9.8 per 100,000 for Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 9.1
per 100,000 for Hispanics.</p>

<p>Digging
deeper, the analysis showed that liver cancer incidence varies from state to
state, and by race and ethnicity within each state.</p>

<p>Much of the
disparity is due to a lack of public health education for certain at-risk groups.
</p>

<p>Many of
these same populations often also have limited access to quality healthcare.</p>


<h2>Catching cancer early</h2>

<p>The
five-year survival rate after a diagnosis of liver cancer has been increasing
ever since the early 1990s.</p>

<p>The increase,
however, varies among racial and ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Generally, non-Hispanic
whites have a lower death rate from liver cancer than blacks.</p>

<p>One of the
reasons is that non-Hispanic whites are more likely to undergo surgery for
their cancer.</p>

<p>Blacks as a
group are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201702.pdf" target="_blank">more likely to lack health insurance</a>, which may cause people to delay testing.</p>

<p>The stage of
liver cancer at the time of diagnosis influences the survival rate.</p>

<p>Between 2006
and 2012, people with localized cancers accounted for between 40 and 45 percent
of all liver cancer diagnoses. These patients had a survival rate of 37
percent.</p>

<p>That rate
dropped to 4 percent for distant stage cancer diagnoses.</p>

<p>When researchers
factored race and ethnicity into their analysis of localized disease, they saw
a marked difference in survival rates. </p>

<p>It is
possible to narrow the gap in survival rates between ethnic and racial groups?</p>

<p>Researchers
believe the key is in finding ways to diagnose more liver cancers when they are
still in the early, more localized stages.</p>



<h2>Over the hump by 2030?</h2>

<p>Death rates
are expected to continue rising through 2030, and then begin to fall. Bilchik
and Jacoub suggested a few possible reasons for the decline.</p>

<p>Baby boomers
are currently the most at-risk generation for hepatitis C. Their numbers will
continue to shrink as time passes.</p>

<p>In the
meantime, more effective public health education will increase the number of
baby boomers who seek out testing for hepatitis C.</p>

<p>Also, public
education efforts worldwide should increase the number of people receiving hepatitis
B vaccinations.</p>

<p>In time, the
costs of treating hepatitis C will decline.</p>

<p>Fast food
restaurants will continue the current trend of offering foods that are more
nutritious.</p>

<p>The number
of tobacco smokers should continue to decline.</p>

<p>Jacoub
stressed, ?It?s important to know your risk profile.?</p>

<p>And Bilchik
pointed out, ?If you think about it, primary liver cancer is largely
preventable because most of the causes of liver cancer are related to
lifestyle.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-26T12:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-26T12:00:00</updateddate><category>Cancer</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/liver-cancer-rates-continue-increase</guid><dc:date>2017-06-26T12:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Don?t ?Eat for Two? While Pregnant</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/dont-eat-for-two-while-pregnant </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of women gain more weight than
they should while pregnant.</p>

<p>That?s according to a recent global <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586887" target="_blank">review</a>.</p>

<p>And that?s a big problem.</p>

<p>Researchers say these
mothers-to-be are setting themselves up to be heavier throughout their lives
and increasing the health risks for their children. </p>

<p>For starters, a baby is likely to be born too
big if the mother gains excessive weight during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Bigger babies may have a higher risk of heart
disease and obesity later in life. The same is true for babies born quite
small. </p>

<p>Among Americans, earlier <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725659" target="_blank">research</a> found 70 percent of overweight women, and 64
percent of obese women gain more than recommended while pregnant. Overall, 53
percent of all women do. </p>

<p>The new review, published in the Journal of
the American Medical Association (JAMA), analyzed data from 23 studies that
included more than 1.3 million women in all. </p>

<p>If a woman gained too much weight, the risk
of bearing a baby considered oversize ? larger than 8 pounds, 3 ounces ? nearly
doubled. These same women increased their risk of a surgical delivery by 30
percent. </p>

<p>They were less likely, however, to have preterm
babies or small ones. </p>




<h2>What?s
the best strategy?</h2>

<p>The analysis didn?t contain surprises,
observers say, but it feeds into the debate about the best pregnancy strategy
for overweight and obese women. </p>

<p>?So many women are entering pregnancy above a
healthy weight,? Helena Teede, an endocrinologist in Australia and a study lead
author, told Healthline in an email.</p>

<p>Ten of the studies were from the United
States, where women tended to be heavier than in the overall sample, she noted.
</p>

<p>Current <a href="https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Weight-Gain-During-Pregnancy" target="_blank">guidelines</a> from the Institute of Medicine,
which are supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG), advise obese women to gain 11 to 20 pounds while pregnant. </p>

<p>Some experts say that?s too much, and that
the most obese might even try to lose weight while carrying. </p>

<p>Teede disagrees.</p>

<p>?The results affirm that women, no matter how
unhealthy their weight, shouldn't lose weight in pregnancy,? she said.</p>

<p>In the new analysis, gaining less than
recommended increased the risk of a preterm birth or undersize baby for women
of all weights, including obese women. </p>

<p>The better goal for obese women: Lose weight
before conceiving.</p>

<p>?It?s incredibly important,? Aaron Caughey, MD,
PhD, who treats at-risk pregnant women at Oregon Health &amp; Science
University, told Healthline. </p>




<h2>How
much you should gain</h2>

<p>You?ll hear while pregnant that you?re
?eating for two.?</p>

<p>Actually, in the first trimester it?s best to
eat normally. Women can eat <a href="http://www.eatright.org/resource/health/pregnancy/prenatal-wellness/healthy-weight-during-pregnancy" target="_blank">350-450 extra calories per day</a> during the next two trimesters,
depending on their starting weight. </p>

<p>Under the Institute of Medicine guidelines,
underweight women should gain around a pound a week in the second and third
trimesters, up to 28 to 40 pounds in all.</p>

<p>If you start off at a normal weight, aim to
gain 25 to 35 pounds. </p>

<p>Overweight women should aim for 15 to 25
pounds, and obese women no more than 20, which averages out to half a pound a
week.</p>

<p>The totals roughly double for twins, if
you?re overweight or obese. </p>

<p>Line up support to eat healthily, too.</p>

<p>?If we see a pregnant woman drinking alcohol,
we say, ?Oh my God, don?t drink alcohol pregnant,?? Caughey noted. ?But when we
see a woman drinking a giant Slurpee, we don?t say anything. It?s potentially
just as harmful as a little bit of alcohol.?</p>




<h2>An
excellent time to start exercising</h2>

<p>Pregnancy is a time
when women may be most open to picking up new <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2612623" target="_blank">good health habits</a>, and exercise during pregnancy
is a good idea, experts say.</p>

<p>?The easiest thing is to walk,? Diana Ramos,
an OB-GYN in the Los Angeles area, told Healthline. </p>

<p>She urges pregnant women who can?t get out to
get exercise at home.</p>

<p>?Instead of sitting down after dinner and
watching TV, stand up and walk in place,? she suggested.</p>

<p>ACOG <a href="http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise-During-Pregnancy-and-the-Postpartum-Period" target="_blank">recommends</a> that women without major medical
or obstetric complications get at least 20 to 30 minutes of moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise on most days of the week, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982752/" target="_blank">research</a> suggests most American women are
getting less. </p>

<p>Especially combined with careful eating,
exercise may help women avoid gaining too much, reduce surgical deliveries and
hypertension, and cut the chances of an oversize newborn or a baby with
breathing problems, according to a <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD007145/PREG_diet-and-exercise-interventions-for-preventing-excessive-weight-gain-during-pregnancy" target="_blank">2015 research review</a> reported by the Cochrane
Library. </p>

<p>Even obese women and women with high blood
pressure or gestational diabetes may safely exercise, according to a jointly-authored
<a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2612623" target="_blank">opinion piece</a> published in JAMA in March.</p>

<p>In fact, the authors pointed out that
mistaken advice not to exercise combined with gaining weight had turned
pregnancy into ?a major contributor to the worldwide obesity epidemic,? with
post-birth health risks for mothers and babies.</p>





<h2>Lifelong
consequences</h2>

<p>One big reason pregnancy is contributing to
the obesity epidemic is that too many women aren?t losing their pregnancy gain.</p>

<p>In a five-site U.S. <a href="http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Citation/2015/01000/Postpartum_Weight_Retention_Risk_Factors_and.23.aspx" target="_blank">study</a> reported in 2015 in the journal Obstetrics
and Gynecology, about 75 percent of the participants were heavier a year after
giving birth than before their pregnancy.</p>

<p>Nearly half had kept 10 extra pounds, and 24
percent had kept 20 pounds. In this group, 40 percent of the participants were
of normal weight before pregnancy, but a third of them had become obese or
overweight a year later.</p>

<p>This also sets up the children for future
obesity. </p>

<p>There?s evidence that a ?set point? for
weight is established in the womb, Caughey observed, with lingering effects. </p>

<p>For example, a 2012 German <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033205" target="_blank">study</a> published in PLOS ONE found that
women who gained too much pregnancy weight linked to a 28 percent increase in
the chance that their 5-year-old or 6-year-old was overweight, even if these
women were of a normal weight.</p>

<p>The children of mothers who are obese are
much more likely to become obese and stay that way.</p>

<p>?It?s important as parents to set a role
model for children of healthy habits,? Ramos told Healthline. </p>

<p>The best idea is to improve your habits
before you conceive, Caughey said.</p>

<p>?If you?re even thinking of becoming pregnant
in a year or two, eat better and exercise,? he said.</p>

<p>After you give birth, keep up the exercise.</p>

<p>Ramos <a href="http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2016/05001/Choose_Health_LA_MOMs___A_Novel_Approach_to.268.aspx" target="_blank">founded a program</a> in Los Angeles called <a href="https://www.choosehealthla.com/moms/" target="_blank">Choose Health LA Moms</a> that texted new mothers three
times a week for three months, urging them to breastfeed, walk, and drink
water.</p>

<p>On average, moms in the program lost nearly
all their pregnancy gain and ?the whole family ended up walking more,? Ramos

developing, can be especially vulnerable to developing autism with these
dangers while still in the womb.</p>

<p>That?s according to two recent studies. </p>

<p>In them, researchers also concluded that lower
levels of vital minerals like manganese and zinc in babies were also linked to
autism. </p>

<p>However, the truly groundbreaking part of one
of the studies, experts said, is that lasers are now being used to analyze baby
teeth to look for signs of autism.</p>

<p>Previously, teeth had to be ground up. </p>

<p>The upshot is that autism can now be found ? and
treated ? at an earlier age.</p>

<p>?If we can identify higher risk children, we
can follow them more closely,? Cindy Lawler, PhD, lead representative for
extramural autism activities at the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (NIEHS), which funded the study, told Healthline. ?Sometimes the child
is several years old before they receive that diagnosis.?</p>


<h2>Genes
vs. environment</h2>

<p>Because baby teeth have rings, much like
trees, they can be analyzed for developmental disorders. </p>

<p>?Now we can look at our biological hard
drive,? Manish Arora, PhD, an environmental scientist and dentist at the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, and a lead researcher on the
study, told Healthline. ?It?s constantly recording information.?</p>

<p>Blood tests for autism, he added, are less
useful because they can?t pinpoint when autism starts.</p>

<p>The researchers <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/baby-teeth-link-autism-heavy-metals-nih-study-suggests" target="_blank">studied the link</a> between autism and heavy metals
by comparing teeth from 32 pairs of twins and 12 single twins.</p>

<p>This type of finding is nothing new, though,
say experts.</p>

<p>More importantly, the study pinpoints risk at
early ages in development, explained Thomas Frazier, PhD, chief science officer
at Autism Speaks.</p>

<p>?Despite having this knowledge, we still do a
terrible job as a society at reducing or eliminating the problem,? Frazier told
Healthline.</p>

<p>People wanting to make an immediate impact
should address lead exposure in children, he added.</p>

<p>This study also helps narrow down the
potential gene associated with autism, explained Aisha Dickerson, PhD, a
postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>

<p>?A common theory with autism says that
there?s a genetic factor with an environmental trigger,? she told Healthline.</p>

<p>So, some kids with certain genotypes can
process metal while others can?t.</p>

<p>In any case, you can?t alter genes, but you can
alter your environment, said Dickerson. </p>

<p>?Our environment is constantly changing,?
agreed Arora. ?And our internal environment is changing, too. But fetuses and
newborns are highly susceptible to environmental stressors.?</p>

<p>So, he
added, environment is a crucial component to a baby?s health. </p>

<p>The connection between pollution and autism
is also being studied, added Arora. </p>

<p>In the same study, lower levels of zinc and
manganese were also linked to autism. And they?re both essential ingredients
for brain development.</p>

<p>?Something happens that disrupts the
metabolism,? he said. ?But we don?t know what it is.? </p>



<h2>A
feverish link?</h2>

<p>Finding the link between fevers and infection
in pregnant mothers and autism has been dicier, though, said Lawler.</p>

<p>?A larger body of work is asking whether
infection is linked to autism,? she said. ?But a clear picture hasn?t emerged.?</p>

<p>For the other <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170613102024.htm" target="_blank">study</a> that linked fever during
pregnancy to autism, led by scientists at the Center for Infection and Immunity
at Columbia University?s Mailman School of Public Health, 95,754 children were
followed over 10 years. </p>

<p>Results showed that expectant mothers who had
fevers during the second trimester of pregnancy raised the odds of autism by 40
percent.</p>

<p>Autism risk was more than tripled for
children of women who had three or more fevers after 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>?The next question that needs to be asked is
whether it?s due to inflammation,? said Frazier. ?If so, what specific
biological processes are driving the relationship??</p>



<h2>Eat
healthy, stay healthy</h2>

<p>To protect a baby during pregnancy or shortly
after birth, pay attention to current lead exposure, counseled Lawler. </p>

<p>The biggest danger is living in older homes
with lead in paint, she added. But minimizing exposure to lead during home
renovation is also important. </p>

<p>Water usually isn?t a prime cause of lead
exposure, said Dickerson. But she advises mothers to test water where they
live. </p>

<p>As for avoiding fevers during pregnancy, she
advocates staying healthy.</p>

<p>?Make sure to eat a healthy diet with leafy
green vegetables, she added, ?and wash your hands.? Vegetables should also be
thoroughly washed.</p>

<p>And Lawler says that prenatal multivitamins
with folate might be helpful. But they shouldn?t be excessively used either,
she added. </p>

<p>When in doubt, consult your physician on prenatal
supplements, concluded Frazier.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-23T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-23T16:00:00</updateddate><category>General Health,Women's Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/lead-exposure-fevers-during-pregnancy-can-lead-to-autism</guid><dc:date>2017-06-23T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Accidental Deaths Are on the Rise</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/accidental-deaths-on-the-rise </link><description><![CDATA[<p>The
number of accidental deaths in the United States has been growing for years,
and nobody seems to be paying attention.</p>

<p>According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), accidents are now the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" target="_blank">fourth
leading cause of
death</a> in
the United States. As of 2014, that meant 136,053 deaths per year. That number
sits far behind the two leading causes of death in the United States: heart
disease (614,348 deaths per year) and cancer (591,699 deaths per year).</p>

<p>However,
it may surprise many that accidents kill more people annually than numerous
other conditions, including stroke, Alzheimer?s, and diabetes.</p>




<h2>How did we get here?</h2>

<p>That?s
precisely what author Steve Casner examined in his new book, ?Careful: A User?s Guide to Our Injury-Prone
Minds.? Casner works as a research psychologist at NASA, and holds an
interdisciplinary PhD in psychology, computer science, and medicine from the
University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>?We?ve
got this problem with injuries. Fatalities are, for the first time in 100
years, starting to creep up,? he told Healthline.</p>

<p>?There
is so much discussion of other diseases, and there should be, but here?s one
that has just become the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S., and it?s
being underdiscussed.?</p>

<p>His
book begins as a primer on public safety: the diligent ways laws and
technological developments have made people safer and safer. Owing to common
sense rules and devices like drunk-driving laws (first enacted in 1939), seat
belts, and smoke alarms, the accidental death rate dropped for most the 20th
century.</p>

<p>By
1992, the number of accidental deaths in the United States had been halved from
1 in 20, to 1 in 40.</p>

<p>After
that, ?The fatality rate just sort of stayed where it was for the next eight
years,? Casner wrote in his book. ?And then it started rising again.?</p>




<h2>A perfect recipe for
disaster</h2>

<p>The
reason for this is multifold: technological, social, and psychological ? and
all three tend to overlap heavily.</p>

<p>The
most apparent technological danger, especially for teenagers and parents of
teenagers, are cellphones. According to a <a href="http://www.nsc.org/DistractedDrivingDocuments/Cell-Phone-Estimate-Summary-2013.pdf" target="_blank">study by the National Safety Council</a>, more than a quarter of all car
crashes in the United States are attributed to cell phone usage.</p>

<p>Those
numbers are also believed to be <a href="http://www.nsc.org/DistractedDrivingDocuments/NSC-Under-Reporting-White-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">underreported</a>.</p>

<p>However,
as Healthline <a href="/health-news/tech-texting-while-walking-causes-accidents-031014">reported last year</a>, distracted walking is becoming just as
prevalent and dangerous. </p>

<p>A
common talking point of 2016 was the release of ?Pokemon Go,? an augmented reality
game that required players to actually get up and walk around outside in order
to play. </p>

<p>The
game inadvertently led to numerous tragic incidents ? like <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/terrible-things-happening-to-pokemon-go-players/5/" target="_blank">falling off cliffs</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/60-year-old-grandfather-killed-security-guard-while-playing-pokemon-n715311" target="_blank">violent altercations</a> after entering private property ? due to
players intently focusing on their cell phones, rather than the world around
them.</p>

<p>?We?re
going to have to adopt a whole new attitude towards being careful, and learn
something about how we may not be well-adapted to modern living,? said Casner. </p>

<p>?We?re
retooling our world so quickly in ways that challenge our everyday intuitions
about survival, and cell phones are just the latest example.?</p>




<h2>More stoplights won?t help</h2>

<p>Casner
accepts that cell phone usage is partially to blame, but he doesn?t point his
finger at it specifically for the rise in accidental deaths.</p>

<p>Essentially,
we have come to the end of the line in which ?putting rubber corners on stuff?
or implementing new safety precautions is any more effective than thirty years
ago.</p>

<p>Take,
for example, the Dutch village of Eerbeek that is testing LED traffic signals <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/3/28/15080478/pedestrian-crossing-lights-sign-ground" target="_blank">built right into the pavement</a> so distracted pedestrians staring down at
their phones will notice them. Casner called this kind of safety mechanism a ?Band-Aid
solution.?</p>

<p>Instead,
Casner wrote, ?The next safety revolution is going to have to happen in our own
minds.?</p>




<h2>We?re not built for
multitasking </h2>

<p>Going
back to the issue of cell phones, and the myriad distractions they have
introduced to everyday life, Casner is more concerned with the psychology of
distraction, rather than the phone itself.</p>

<p>Multitasking
? driving and using a smartphone, for example ? is far more taxing on the human
brain than we seem to believe, and that makes it incredibly dangerous.</p>

<p>?We
really need to think about the human limits of our ability to pay attention,?
he said.</p>

<p>The
phone is just the current iteration of a larger psychosocial issue.</p>

<p>?In
ten years, this big concern over cell phones will be eclipsed by something even
bigger,? said Casner.</p>

<p>However,
what he hopes is that his work will play some part in making people more aware
of these dangers, and to just pay a bit more attention in their daily lives to
the things going on around them. </p>

<p>For
all the thought that we give to exercise, diet, and heart disease, we need to
be more careful with how we conduct our lives in an increasingly distracted world.</p>

<p>?If
we keep pushing ahead with medical advancements and we all live to be 150, the
sad truth is that we probably won?t, because we may get killed doing something
long before that? he said.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-23T11:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-23T11:00:00</updateddate><category>General Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/accidental-deaths-on-the-rise</guid><dc:date>2017-06-23T11:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Meal Prepping May Actually Be Sabotaging Your Diet</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/meal-prepping-may-actually-be-sabotaging-your-diet </link><description><![CDATA[<p>If your Sunday nights are dedicated
to meal prepping for the week ahead, you?re part of a mighty group of health
nuts.</p>

<p>The planning ahead of meals is a
main tip of weight loss coaches, food bloggers, and nutritionists.</p>

<p>Indeed, meal prepping?s popularity
has exploded on social media. On Instagram alone there are 5.5 million photos
tagged #mealprep and 1.1 million tagged #foodprep.</p>

<p>While perfectly portioned-out food
for seven days does make for the perfect #foodporn snapshot, meal preppers are
onto an idea that ? at least in concept ? is good for your diet, according to
research. </p>

<p>People who spend more time preparing meals are
more likely to have healthier diets, according to a 2014 study published in the
<a href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(14)00400-0/fulltext" target="_blank">American Journal of Preventive Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>They eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>They also eat at fast food restaurants only half
as often as people who only spend less than an hour each day prepping and
cooking their meals.</p>

<p>In addition, they spend less money on food.</p>

<p>More recently, a <a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0461-7" target="_blank">2017 study</a> of 40,000 adults in
France found that people who meal prepped at least a few days at a time were
less likely to be overweight and stuck more closely to nutritional guidelines.</p>

<p>The survey also found that meal prepping led to
more food variety over the week.</p>

<p>Portion control is one key
way food prepping helps people maintain a healthy weight or lose a few pounds.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105579/" target="_blank">review
of several studies</a> around the role of portion control in weight
management showed that eating the appropriate amount of food is directly
linked.</p>

<p>One component of portion control that
researchers stress is choosing the right portions of water-rich foods, like
fruits and vegetables, and eating less energy-dense foods ? like most fast
foods and candy.</p>

<p>If you prep your food, it?s easier to not only
eat the right amount, but to avoid foods that are bad for you but
oh-so-tempting.</p>



<h2>Food containers contain hazards</h2>

<p>However, if you?re portioning food
out into plastic containers, all of that healthy preparation could actually
create a new barrier to staying trim.</p>

<p>Dr. Aly Cohen, a rheumatologist, as
well as an integrative medicine and environmental health specialist who is on
staff at the <a href="https://www.centrastate.com/" target="_blank">CentraState Medical Center</a>,
explained.</p>

<p>?An effective diet is not just
about healthy eating, managing sugar and carbohydrates, and exercise,? she told
Healthline. ?Reducing chemical exposure is also key because many of these
chemicals can disrupt normal hormone function, impede weight loss, and even
cause weight gain. Just because chemicals may not have an obvious effect, like
causing a rash, doesn't mean they aren?t tinkering with your body.?</p>

<p>Whipping up a big batch of healthy
chili, scooping it out into several plastic containers, and quickly reheating
it in the microwave come mealtime is one example of how a healthy meal prep
turns into several dinners brimming with the harmful hormone-disrupting
chemical bisphenol A (BPA).</p>

<p>BPA is found in polycarbonate
plastic (plastic #7) and canned food linings, as well as many other things that
we touch every day ? including our smartphones. </p>

<p>?Most human exposure to BPA is through
ingestion from canned products, but BPA can also be absorbed by touching paper
that uses BPA to seal ink onto its surface [e.g., receipts, airplane and
parking tickets, currency] and then touching your hands to your lips. BPA can
also be absorbed in smaller amounts through the skin,? Cohen said.</p>

<p>Cohen noted that BPA is pervasive ?
8 billion pounds of BPA are made every year ? since it?s one of the cheapest
ways to make packaging.</p>

<p>BPA and ? if your plastic container
is marked ?BPA-free? ? similar, sometimes more harmful chemicals are lurking in
your plastic food storage set of containers.</p>

<p>Heating up plastic containers by
putting hot food in them or microwaving them can draw out BPA ? right into your
food.</p>



<h2>How BPA affects the body</h2>

<p>BPA was first discovered in 1891 and
then rediscovered in 1936, according to Cohen.</p>

<p>?It was used as an estrogen
replacement drug for women, and
it was also used to fatten poultry and cattle. In the 1940s it was discovered
that linking the molecules together created a hard, clear, glass-like plastic,?
she said.</p>

<p>BPA can confuse the
endocrine system, which regulates hormones, by mimicking estrogen.</p>

<p>We?re regularly ingesting
BPA, and therefore continually disrupting the messages that help our bodies
function properly. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/bisphenola_factsheet.html" target="_blank">90 percent</a>
of people have detectable levels of BPA in their systems.</p>

<p>To date, nearly 100 studies
have been published tying BPA to various health problems, from diabetes and
cardiovascular disease to infertility, according to the Endocrine Society and <a href="http://ipen.org/documents/introduction-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-edcs" target="_blank">IPEN's
Introduction to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals</a>.</p>

<p>Some other effects of too much BPA exposure are
directly contrary to weight loss and healthy eating goals.</p>



<h2>BPA may be wrecking your diet</h2>

<p>BPA passes through a person?s
system fairly quickly, but detoxifying still isn?t easy.</p>

<p>?Despite the fact that BPA has a short half-life of six
hours, which means an exposure will wash out over a day or so, people continue
to have high blood levels,? Cohen noted.</p>

<p>?There are two problems with BPA,? added Laura Vandenberg, PhD, a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/" target="_blank">Endocrine Society</a>, and
an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst. ?One is that we are constantly exposed in our environment, so the levels
never really seem to drop. Even in people that have been fasting, metabolite
levels in urine are still detected. The second problem is that, if exposures
occur during a vulnerable period of development, like fetal development, the
effects can be permanent ? even if exposures cease.?</p>

<p>For adult meal-planning fanatics, constant
re-exposure to BPA may mean that meal prepping is actually sabotaging your
diet.</p>

<p>?BPA is so ubiquitous, that humans are continuously
exposed, making BPA ?pseudo-persistent,?? Cohen said. ?What?s interesting in terms of weight is that
BPA can turn stem cells into fat cells and make fat cells turn larger. That?s
not great news for our waistlines ? let alone our overall health.?</p>

<p>A study published in <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1409143/" target="_blank">Environmental Health Perspectives</a> in 2015 was the first study
to prove that BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G), which accounts for 80 to 90 percent of
the metabolites your liver produces when processing BPA, doesn?t just get
excreted from your body.</p>

<p>The researchers showed that BPA is an active agent
that can prompt cells to become fat cells. </p>

<p>That?s not the only proven way that BPA exposure can
interfere with your weight goals.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323920" target="_blank">study</a> published in Endocrinology found that BPA exposure makes
it much harder for you to feel full.</p>

<p>While meal prepping helps
with portion control, the BPA in the plastic food storage containers may
ironically be causing people to want to eat larger portions.</p>





<h2>?BPA-free? label doesn?t equal safe </h2>

<p>Even buying plastic containers
marked ?BPA-free? doesn?t protect you from the harmful effects of plastic.</p>

<p>Some BPA-free products can actually
release estrogen-simulating chemicals that are more potent than BPA.</p>

<p>?Many products are now labeled
?BPA-free.? However, BPA is often replaced with bisphenol S [BPS] and bisphenol
F [BPF], which are less studied but appear to have similar hormone-disrupting
effects,? Rebecca Fuoco, MPH, director of Health Research Communication
Strategies, told Healthline.</p>

<p>That means scientists and activists
that study toxic chemicals like BPA and push to remove them from everyday
products often end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out what?s in the
new compound.</p>

<p>?When a chemical is found to be
harmful, manufacturers change the molecule ever so slightly and put it out to
market again,? noted Cohen. ?From BPA came BPS, BPF, and BP-FB, which are
molecules that have been found thus far to have more harmful effects than the
chemical they were designed to replace ? also known as ?regrettable
substitutions.? Researchers are essentially playing whack-a-mole, because
plastics and their ingredients are proprietary and considered ?trade secrets,?
so the recipes and ingredients are not shared with researchers or consumers.?</p>



<h2>Policy favors manufacturers</h2>

<p>In <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/4-7-million-tons-of-BPA-expected-to-be-made-in-12-3449877.php" target="_blank">2012,
4.7 million metric tons of BPA</a>, valued at about $8 billion, was estimated
to have been produced, according to <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/" target="_blank">GlobalData</a>.</p>

<p>And reports of the harmful effects
aren?t slowing production. The demand for BPA has risen 6 to 10 percent
annually. </p>

<p>Oleoresin is a vegetable-based
alternative that can add about two cents to the cost of manufacturing of cans, according
to Cohen.</p>

<p>So far, it has only been used in a
small percentage of cans on the market.</p>

<p>?Our government has given more
priority to manufacturers than to consumers. The vast majority of food packing ingredients are going out to
market without ever being tested for toxicity,? Cohen said.</p>

<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297954.htm" target="_blank">Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)</a> still considers BPA to be safe, stating
on its website that their research has ?showed that BPA is rapidly metabolized
and eliminated through feces and urine.?</p>

<p>On the other hand, regulatory agencies in
Europe have recently re-evaluated BPA. Last week, there was
widespread agreement by countries in the European Union that this chemical
should be labeled a human endocrine disruptor. </p>

<p>For Americans, though, toxic chemicals like
BPA remain a concern.</p>

<p>?We shouldn't expect individual consumers
to have detailed knowledge of chemistry to make safe decisions for themselves
or their families. Safety decisions should be made by regulators using the best
available evidence. I will continue to push for improved regulations that use
modern data to protect public health,? Vandenberg told Healthline.</p>


<h2>Four ways to avoid harmful diet-sabotaging
chemicals</h2>

<p>Even though BPA-riddled plastic
containers are out there, Vandenberg and Cohen noted that people can still make
small changes over time that add up.</p>

<p>Here are some ways to ensure your
food containers aren?t keeping you from losing weight.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Buy
glass, ceramic, or stainless steel food containers</strong>. While cost can be a
concern, avoid plastic containers whenever possible and invest in glass,
ceramic, or stainless steel food storage containers instead. Remember that you
shouldn?t assume that a ?BPA-free? label means a plastic container is safe.</li><li><strong>Don?t
heat up plastic containers or use harsh detergents to clean them</strong>. If you
can?t shell out the cash for new glass food containers, there are still ways to
make using your plastic containers safer. Using harsh cleaning supplies to wash
your plastics or heating them up can increase leaching of BPA into food. Use
eco-friendly soaps, never microwave plastics, and don?t pour hot liquids into
your containers. </li><li><strong>Toss out
worn or cracked BPA containers</strong>. Another way to make plastic containers
safer is by tossing out the ones that are broken down or cracked. Clear hard
plastic can often turn opaque from washing, and is more prone to breaking down
in your food. Throw those containers into the trash and just use your newest,
intact plastic containers.</li><li><strong>Buy fresh
produce</strong>. ?If you can, switch from canned food to flash-frozen organic ? or
even non-organic ? food. Aim to buy fresh food whenever possible,? Cohen
recommended. ?Buying fresh foods instead of canned is also good, if possible.
But eating healthy is also important, and if canned vegetables are the only
affordable choice, they are better than no vegetables at all.? Vanderberg said.</li></ul>







<p>Meal-prepping in plastic is still
better than no meal prepping at all, if it helps you eat healthier.</p>

<p>?These chemicals are ubiquitous ?
they?re everywhere. You should do the best you can. Cutting chemicals out of
your life is a journey, not a race. Every day I learn something new and try to
add it into my life,? Cohen said.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-23T11:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-23T11:00:00</updateddate><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/meal-prepping-may-actually-be-sabotaging-your-diet</guid><dc:date>2017-06-23T11:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Do You Know All the Symptoms of Lyme Disease?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/do-you-know-all-they-symptoms-of-lyme-disease </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Many
parts of the United States expect to see an increase in ticks this summer, so renewed
calls have gone out for people to be on the lookout for the distinctive, and
less distinctive, symptoms of Lyme disease.</p>

<p>The
calls are raising questions about the future of Lyme disease diagnosis and
prevention as infections become more common.</p>

<p>An
increase in the number of mice in the Northeast this year signals a likely
increase in ticks carrying Lyme disease, according to <a href="/health-news/summer-tick-season">predictions</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>The ticks live on mice and other animals such as deer.</p>

<p>In
addition, factors like milder winters and urban sprawl into wooded areas are
increasing people?s potential exposure to infected ticks.</p>

<p>?When
we see rodent populations rise, we see an uptick in Lyme disease cases,? said
Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins Center
for Health Security.</p>




<h2>More contact</h2>

<p>Adalja
has seen an increase in Lyme disease cases in recent years, and credits
increased testing and people coming into contact with ticks more often as the
primary causes.</p>

<p>?We?re
picking up a lot more cases than we would have before,? he told Healthline,
noting that some emergency rooms test anyone with a fever for Lyme.</p>

<p>Adalja
added that ?with people moving into areas that were forested areas, you?re
going to see more chances to come into contact with ticks.?</p>

<p>Thomas
Mather, a professor at the University of Rhode Island specializing in
tick-borne diseases, is seeing similar trends.</p>

<p>?There?s
a lot to be said about the distribution of people and animals. Animals are
finding they can live in closer proximity to humans,? he told Healthline.</p>

<p>For
example, if white-tailed deer are no longer being hunted in a certain area,
they?re able to live closer to people.</p>

<p>That
spread, combined with milder winters, are also allowing the spread of ticks
like the lone star tick, which can spread <a href="/health-news/tick-borne-heartland-virus-infects-eight-032714#2" target="_blank">ehrlichiosis</a>, and has expanded its range northward in recent decades.</p>

<p>?I
feel we?re in a more-ticks-in-more-places world,? Mather said.</p>




<h2>Symptom awareness</h2>

<p>That
makes it more important than ever to be aware of the early symptoms of Lyme
disease, doctors say.</p>

<p>Mather
warned in particular about ticks still in their nymphal stage. They are poppy
seed-sized dots that are more likely to be lower on a person?s body where they
may be harder to spot, or affixed in rarely checked places.</p>

<p>But
adult ticks spread diseases like Lyme, too, and catching the symptoms of
infection can be tricky.</p>

<p>?There?s
the characteristic rash that everybody?s on the look for,? Adalja said.</p>

<p>That
bull?s-eye rash ? a solid dot with a red circle around it ? can develop at a
tick-bite site, indicating Lyme disease transmission.</p>

<p>?When
people have the rash, the diagnosis is very simple,? Adalja said.</p>

<p>But
if there?s no rash or it went unnoticed, then there are other factors to
consider.</p>

<p>Primarily,
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html" target="_blank">location</a>. </p>

<p>Ninety-five
percent of Lyme disease cases are in 14 states, concentrated in the Northeast
and bordering the Great Lakes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>?If
you have them in the area, it always has to be in your mind somewhere? when
trying to make a diagnosis, Adalja said.</p>

<p>Later
diagnoses can be tricky ? particularly if the patient never noticed the tick
bite ? because the flu-like symptoms might be confused for other fatigue or muscle
ache-inducing ailments.</p>

<p>Doctors
are sometimes hesitant to prescribe an antibiotic regimen that might have
adverse side effects without a firm idea that Lyme is to blame.</p>

<p>?Sometimes,
it?s just the rash itself, but sometimes they don?t get it or notice it. In
those situations, it?s hard because lots of things can have those symptoms,?
Adalja said.</p>




<h2>Better diagnostics,
treatments</h2>

<p>But
as Lyme disease risk grows, diagnostic methods will need to improve.</p>

<p>Adalja
said the current <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/diagnosistesting/labtest/twostep/index.html" target="_blank">two-step blood test method</a> recommended by the CDC can give
false negatives.</p>

<p>He?d
like to see wider use of newer testing methods, such as a ?<a href="https://www.esciencecentral.org/journals/c-peptide-test-a-key-to-diagnosis-of-early-lyme-disease-2327-5073.1000158.php?aid=27655" target="_blank">C6 peptide test</a>? that is more sensitive to the presence of
Lyme disease, and can detect strains of the Lyme-spreading bacteria from Europe,
as well as from the United States.</p>

<p>New
tests like these are already available and being used, but they aren?t yet the
official recommendations. New guidelines are currently under revision, Adalja
said. </p>

<p>Aside
from prevention and early detection, the other tactic for battling the
increasing spread of Lyme disease would be a vaccine.</p>

<p>There
currently are no vaccines for humans available. One introduced in 1998 was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/52/suppl_3/s253/444754/Vaccines-against-Lyme-Disease-What-Happened-and" target="_blank">withdrawn</a> from the market when it caused
adverse reactions in some patients and suffered poor sales.</p>

<p>Others
are in development, but experts believe it will be a while before anything is introduced.</p>

<p>Plus,
any vaccine will need to go beyond covering just Lyme disease for it to avoid
the problems of the old vaccine.</p>

<p>Mather
said there?s ?a real need for effective vaccines,? but that the same ticks that
can transmit Lyme disease can transmit other diseases and viruses as well. </p>

<p>With
past vaccines, he said, ?People thought they were protected, but, well, you?re
not protected against these other germs. It would be irresponsible to have a
single vaccine that protects against one germ when [ticks] transmit other
germs, too.?</p>

<p>He
thinks the future of vaccines against tick-borne diseases will focus on
impeding the transmission process rather than mitigating specific diseases.</p>

<p>That
could mean something that would equip the body to respond at the tick-bite site
and make it an inhospitable site for disease-causing bacteria.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-23T10:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-23T10:00:00</updateddate><category>Outdoor Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/do-you-know-all-they-symptoms-of-lyme-disease</guid><dc:date>2017-06-23T10:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>CDC Reveals Spread of Mosquitoes Able to Carry Zika</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/cdc-reveals-spread-of-mosquitoes-able-to-carry-zika </link><description><![CDATA[<p>With
summer heat and humidity bringing out mosquitoes, health officials have been
especially concerned about a possible return of the Zika virus.</p>

<p>In
Florida where the majority of the Zika outbreaks in the United States occurred,
state health officials continue to spray for mosquitoes and closely monitor
pregnant women for any sign of the disease, which can cause serious birth
defects. </p>

<p>?Zika remains
a threat for Floridians, especially pregnant women and their infants after they
are born, and women who will become pregnant,? Florida Surgeon General and
Secretary of Health, Dr. Celeste Philip, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2017/05/051717-zika-clinician-call.html" target="_blank">said during a call</a> to health providers
in May.</p>

<p>A
study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published this
week revealed another factor that could increase the risk of a Zika outbreak: The
mosquitoes that spread the virus have been expanding their habitat in the United
States.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjx088/3868585/Updated-Reported-Distribution-of-Aedes-Stegomyia#88336498" target="_blank">report</a>, an update from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/53/5/1169/1751696/Reported-Distribution-of-Aedes-Stegomyia-aegypti" target="_blank">one
published last year</a>,
found that the
<em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito, which was
responsible for most of the spread of the Zika virus, and the <em>Aedes albopictus</em>, which is less
connected to the Zika virus but can transmit other tropical diseases like dengue
and chikungunya, have spread even farther in the United States than originally
thought. </p>

<p>The CDC researchers
reported that <em>Ae. aegypti</em> specimens
had been found in 28 states and 220 counties from 1995 to December 2016. The <em>Ae. albopictus</em> was found in 1,368
counties in 40 states and the District of Columbia during that time. </p>

<p>This report showed
a significant rise in the number of areas where these insects are found.
Between 1995 to 1999 the <em>Ae. aegy</em>pti
was found in just 11 counties and three states (Arizona, Texas, and Florida).
During that same time period the <em>Ae. albopictus</em>
was found in 370 counties,
virtually all in the Southeast region of the country, although it was also
identified in Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>Today the <em>Ae. albopictus</em> has been found as far
west as California and as far north as Washington and New Hampshire. </p>



<h2>A widening area of concern</h2>

<p>Published
in the Journal of
Medical Entomology, the updated report revealed
that mosquito species were actually even more spread out than initially
realized. </p>

<p>After mosquito surveillance increased due to the threat of
Zika infection, CDC researchers surveyed local officials about what they found
from March through the end of December to see if more specimens were being
found.</p>

<p>They discovered officials in an additional 38 counties had
found an <em>Ae. aegypti</em> specimen, and officials
in a whopping 127 counties found at least one <em>Ae. albopictus</em> specimen. This means compared with the original 2016
report, there were 10 and 21 percent increases in the total number
of counties where <em>Ae. albopict</em>us and <em>Ae. aegypti</em> were found, respectively. </p>

<p>The new numbers are likely the result of increased
surveillance in 2016, and not due to an actual spike in the mosquito
population. </p>

<p>Rebecca Eisen, PhD, research biologist with the CDC's
Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, and co-author of the study, said the study
showed how important local surveillance is in understanding mosquito
populations. </p>

<p>?We expect that with
continued intense surveillance for these species we will undoubtedly produce
additional county collection records, especially in areas that are
environmentally and climatically suitable for the mosquitoes to survive and
reproduce,? she told Healthline in an emailed statement. </p>

<p>Getting this data and
understanding it could be vital to help prevent or fight future outbreaks of
insect-borne diseases. </p>

<p>?This
information will help to target limited public health surveillance resources
and help to improve our understanding of how widespread these mosquitoes are,?
Eisen <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/esoa-ncd061217.php">said in a statement</a> released earlier this week. </p>



<h2>Surveillance efforts not
receiving necessary funding</h2>

<p>Dr.
Ian Lipkin, director, Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia University
Mailman School of Public Health, said the report highlights why robust mosquito
surveillance is important. He added that due to decreases in funding, mosquito
surveillance ?has not received the
support it should.?</p>

<p>&nbsp;?Surveillance was better 20 years ago than it is today,? Lipkin told Healthline. As a result, he
believes the mosquito population is likely undercounted. </p>

<p>?When we're showing more now, it truly is more,? he said of the mosquito population.
</p>

<p>Lipkin added that a warming climate has made
large swaths of the United States habitable for these mosquitoes, particularly
the <em>Ae. albopictus</em>, which was
documented in 40 states. </p>

<p>?It's really worrisome,? Lipkin said. ?We've had dengue in Texas and dengue in Florida ... we're going
to see risk for this up in the Northeast.?</p>

<p>While
cases of the Zika virus have largely dissipated in much of the western
hemisphere, Lipkin said the increasing spread of mosquitoes means more people
could be at risk for a host of other diseases.</p>

<p>?It's becoming a national problem,? he said. ?The other
thing to bear in mind is we don't know what kind of other infectious disease they
may carry.?&nbsp;</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-22T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-22T14:00:00</updateddate><category>Outdoor Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/cdc-reveals-spread-of-mosquitoes-able-to-carry-zika</guid><dc:date>2017-06-22T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Can You Outgrow a Penicillin Allergy?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-you-outgrow-penicillin-allergy </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Having
a true allergy to penicillin is serious.</p>

<p>However,
if you?ve been told you have a penicillin allergy by a doctor who is not an
allergist, you may want to confirm the diagnosis. </p>

<p>While
10 percent of the general population reports having a penicillin allergy,
?Ninety percent of patients labeled as PCN [penicillin] allergic are not,? Dr.
Andrew Murphy, allergist at Asthma, Allergy and Sinus Center in Pennsylvania,
told Healthline.</p>

<p>Avoiding
antibiotics without knowing if you have an allergy can affect your healthcare, added
Dr. David Stukus, pediatric allergist at Nationwide Children?s Hospital in Ohio, and spokesperson for the American
College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology (ACAAI). </p>

<p>Stukus
said it has been well documented in multiple research studies that people with
reported penicillin allergies receive different care than those who do not
report an allergy.</p>

<p>?This
includes use of more expensive and less effective antibiotics. It also
increases risk for side effects from use of more broad spectrum and less specific
antibiotics,? Stukus told Healthline. </p>

<p>Penicillin
and its derivatives (including amoxicillin) are first-line therapy for some of
the most common bacterial infections, such as ear infections, sinusitis, and
pneumonia.</p>



<h2>Misdiagnosis is prominent</h2>

<p>One
reason many people report being allergic to penicillin might be due to
misdiagnosis.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/penicillin-allergy/basics/definition/con-20024205" target="_blank">Mayo
Clinic</a>
says that common symptoms of a penicillin allergic reaction include the
following:</p>

<ul><li>skin rash</li><li>hives</li><li>itching</li><li>fever</li><li>swelling</li><li>shortness of breath</li><li>wheezing</li><li>runny nose</li><li>itchy, watery eyes</li><li>anaphylaxis </li></ul>

<p>But
many side effects from antibiotics, such as rashes and gastrointestinal issues,
are sometimes mislabeled as allergic reactions. </p>

<p>?Children
frequently experience rashes when ill, and especially when ill and taking an
antibiotic. The vast majority of these rashes are not due to any type of
allergic reaction, but are often labeled as such,? explained Stukus. ?This
reported antibiotic allergy can then remain a part of their permanent health
record and rarely, if ever, is clarified.?</p>

<p>?On
a population level, this is a widespread and very costly problem,? Stukus also
noted.</p>


<h2>Get tested by an allergist</h2>

<p>The
problem may be compounded because many physicians not fully educated on penicillin
allergies treat people diagnosed with the condition, according to a survey conducted by ACAAI. </p>

<p>?Allergy
lists are reviewed at every medical encounter and almost all medical personnel,
regardless of training, can enter an allergy onto someone?s chart,? said Stukus.
</p>

<p>The
majority of reported antibiotic allergies are not actually due to an allergic
mechanism, meaning a reaction will not happen again with future exposure, or
will not progress to any more severe reactions, Stukus added.</p>

<p>?This
topic is widely misunderstood by patients and medical providers alike. It is
important for anyone with a suspected or reported antibiotic allergy to clarify
their status, often through consultation with a board certified allergist, as
this will absolutely impact their medical care throughout their lives,? stated Stukus.</p>

<p>Sometimes
doctors may not understand that patients should be tested by an allergist to
confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<p>In
fact, many of the internists and general practitioners surveyed by ACAAI
reported they were not aware that a lot of people who state they have a
penicillin allergy have never been tested for it. </p>

<p>More
than 80 percent of the general practitioners surveyed knew they should refer a
patient with a reported penicillin allergy to an allergist, yet they didn't or
had rarely done so.</p>

<p>?Immediate
onset, IgE-mediated allergic [anaphylactic] allergies to penicillin often
disappear after about 10 years from the last exposure, but may be gone sooner
for some,? Stukus said. ?This is really important for people to understand as
many people continue to report their penicillin allergy throughout their entire
life, even if the suspected reaction happened decades ago.?</p>

<p>Stukus
recommended getting retested for a penicillin allergy every five to 10 years.</p>

<p>Murphy
agreed, stating that an annual allergy test is not necessary.</p><p>

?For patients who outgrow PCN allergy, this
occurs over years to decades. There is some evidence that over time PCN allergy
will fade or resolve. That decision could only be made after the patient was
seen, evaluated, and PCN skin testing and oral challenge was done and the patient
passed,? says Murphy.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-22T13:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-22T13:00:00</updateddate><category>Allergies</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-you-outgrow-penicillin-allergy</guid><dc:date>2017-06-22T13:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>What to Do About Children?s Migraines</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-to-do-about-childrens-migraines </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Few
things are harder on a parent than watching your child suffer and being unable
to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Data
presented earlier this month at the American Headache Society?s 59th annual
scientific meeting in Boston looked at advanced signs of migraines in children.</p>

<p>Learning
to recognize those signs could give patients, parents, and caregivers a heads up
on what?s coming, and to have medication handy.</p>

<p>But
timing is crucial, said Dr. Howard Jacobs, a headache specialist at Nationwide
Children?s Hospital in Ohio, and senior author of the study. ?You don?t want to
give the medication too early or it will wear off by the time the pain starts.?</p>



<h2>Recognizing symptoms</h2>

<p>The
study looked at data from 185 volunteer patients between 5 and 18 years of age,
and noted what symptoms usually preceded the onset of a migraine.</p>

<p>Jacobs
said the research focused on six of the most common premonitory symptoms
typically seen in adults: fatigue, yawning, mood changes, neck stiffness, food
cravings, and urinary changes.</p>

<p>Premonitory, or advance, symptoms are also called ?prodrome.?</p>

<p>Jacobs
told Healthline he found fatigue and mood changes were the most commonly reported
prodrome symptoms. They affected 41 percent of the patients. The other four
symptoms appeared insignificant in this cohort.</p>

<p>?Children
do have migraines,? Jacobs said.</p>

<p>Clinicians
routinely asked the patients and their parents to describe symptoms and
accompanying events. That information provided the data. </p>

<p>?Awareness
is part of an early warning system,? Jacobs said.</p>

<p>He explained
that the sooner you recognize the symptoms, the earlier you can begin
treatment. </p>



<h2>Dreaded pain<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Migraines
are usually the most dreaded of headaches.</p>

<p>How
do you know if a particular headache is a migraine?</p>

<p>According
to the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank">Mayo
Clinic</a>,
the most common headache type is a tension headache. Triggers include stress,
muscle strain, or anxiety.</p>

<p>Tension
headaches aren?t the only type of headache, though. Other types include cluster
and sinus headaches.</p>

<p>Migraines
are intense or severe and often have accompanying symptoms in addition to head
pain.</p>

<p>Symptoms
associated with a migraine headache include: nausea, pain behind one eye or
ear, pain in the temples, seeing spots or flashing lights, sensitivity to light
and/or sound, temporary vision loss, and vomiting.</p>

<p>When
compared with tension or other headache types, migraine headache pain can be
moderate to severe.</p>

<p>Some
people may experience headaches so severe they visit an emergency room. </p>

<p>Migraine
headaches will typically affect only one side of the head but some can affect
both sides.</p>

<p>Other
differences include the pain?s quality. A migraine headache will cause intense
pain that may be throbbing and will make performing daily tasks very difficult.</p>


<h2>Input from parents</h2>

<p>Many
of the children studied were old enough to describe their symptoms, but parents
were routinely questioned as well.</p>

<p>Jacobs
said it was particularly challenging to treat teenagers with migraines, for the
same reason it was hard to get their cooperation in other areas: They don?t
like being told what to do.</p>

<p>Maintaining
health in general has been linked to fewer migraines, but that doesn?t mean a
rebellious 14-year-old is going to agree to behavioral changes, such as getting
eight hours of sleep and eating three healthy meals every day.</p>

<p>?I
point out that if it?s too much of a burden, maybe you?d rather have the
headaches,? he said. ?Getting teens to take ownership of their condition is a
challenge.?</p>

<p>?The
teen and adolescent years can be tricky for everybody ? the teenager, family,
and healthcare providers,? agreed Dr. Jean Moorjani, FAAP, a pediatrician at
Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Florida. </p>

<p>?If
parents are having difficulty with helping their teenager develop daily healthy
habits, remember that a trusted pediatrician or family physician who has a good
ongoing relationship with the family can always be of assistance,? she told
Healthline. </p>

<p>?When
I am taking care of teenagers, I like to ask them what they would like to
become when they get older, or what their goals are in life. As we engage in this
discussion, we talk about what we need to do to help reach those goals. In our
discussion, we talk about the importance of developing healthy habits today,
and how being healthy will help us succeed and reach those goals,? Moorjani
said.</p>



<h2>Family history a factor</h2>

<p>There
was a strong family connection with migraines among those surveyed. Ninety-two
percent of youth who experienced migraines had mothers with family histories of
headaches. With fathers it was 38 percent.</p>

<p>But
family history doesn?t doom a child to a lifetime of pain.</p>

<p>?There
are a number of good medications,? Jacobs said. ?It may take a little trial and
error to find the right one.?</p>

<p>Of
the children in the study, 131 were girls. Jacobs is not sure why. ?Do their
parents pay more attention to [subtle] signs in adolescent girls??</p>

<p>That
is one of many questions that remains to be answered. </p>

<p>?I
look forward to more research regarding this topic, especially since headache
diaries can be useful in monitoring the development of migraines,? Moorjani
added. ?With more information and research, we will be able to better care for
our patients who suffer from migraines.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-22T10:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-22T10:00:00</updateddate><category>Children's Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-to-do-about-childrens-migraines</guid><dc:date>2017-06-22T10:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Monitoring a Cancer Tumor is Sometimes Better Than Aggressive Treatment, Study Finds</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/monitoring-tumor-is-sometimes-better-than-aggressive-treatment </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Not
all tumors are the same.</p>

<p>A recent analysis of breast cancer data reveals that
many small breast cancers are slow-growing and have an excellent outlook. In
fact, many will never cause serious symptoms or require treatment within a
patient?s lifetime.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are fast-growing tumors that can be fatal. They often become a problem before they?re ever detected by
mammography.</p>

<p>Now a research team at Yale has shed a light on
these tumor differences after analyzing invasive breast cancers. Researchers
examined information about cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2013, which they obtained from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. </p>

<p>The data published this month in the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1613680?query=featured_home&amp;" target="_blank">New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</a> showed
that doctors often overdiagnosed or overtreated older patients who had
slow-growing tumors, even though those tumors may likely not have been life-threatening.</p>

<p>The study authors wrote that it didn?t matter so much if the
breast tumor would eventually progress. Instead it only mattered if it progressed
during the patient?s lifetime. </p>

<p>?It
is important that we educate physicians, patients, and the public on the
indolent, slow-growing nature of some breast cancers,? Dr. Donald R. Lannin, professor of surgery at Yale School of Medicine,
and lead author on the paper, said in a <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2017/06/07/mammograms-are-we-overdiagnosing-small-tumors-0" target="_blank">press
release</a>.</p>

<p>?This
knowledge will allow us to individualize treatment options, provide
?personalized medicine,? and avoid the major harms of overdiagnosis, which can
result in overtreatment and the anxiety and fear that a cancer diagnosis
causes,? Lannin said. </p>

<p>The team did not consider noninvasive cancers in
this study. Due to different biologic features, the researchers believe more
study and a separate analysis is warranted to provide further proof of their
results. </p>





<h2>What is overdiagnosis?</h2>

<p>Dr.
Doreen Agnese, a surgical oncologist at <a href="https://cancer.osu.edu" target="_blank">The
Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, told Healthline that it?s
important to define ?overdiagnosis.?</p>

<p>?It?s
kind of a misnomer. It?s not like these patients don?t really have cancer. They
do. The concept of overdiagnosis comes from the fact that some cancers are not
really dangerous ones,? she explained.</p>

<h2>Standard of care in breast
cancer</h2>

<p>However,
when faced with a specific patient and specific cancer, it can be difficult for
doctors to know for certain the best course of action. </p>

<p>The Yale study authors wrote, ?Of course, in an individual case it is not
yet possible to say with certainty that a cancer is overdiagnosed, so treatment
cannot be withheld.? </p>

<p>Dr. Diane M. Radford, staff breast
surgical oncologist at <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>,
and medical director of the breast program at Cleveland Clinic Hillcrest
Hospital, said that statement is true and very telling.</p>

<p>?I think these authors? findings are provocative,?
said Radford. ?They conclude that trials may be helpful in the future to
identify those groups who could receive less treatment. I don't think they are advocating
less treatment now.?</p>

<p>In her experience, patients may choose
to delay surgery for their own reasons. In a study that she and others
presented at the American Society of Breast Surgeons, they found that almost
half of patients had a patient-related factor associated with delays in getting
breast cancer surgery. </p>

<p>Their reasons included vacation,
work-related issues, family commitments, and additional time needed to consider
treatment options.</p>

<p>?I would be more comfortable with a
patient delaying treatment who has a small hormone receptor-positive cancer
than a patient with a high-grade triple-negative cancer,? said Radford.</p>

<p>She also cautioned that some cancers
are so small that they never show up on breast imaging, even MRI. Yet they can
present as axillary nodal metastases. ?Small,? she said, certainly doesn?t
equate with ?indolent.?</p>

<p>?I think it would be going out on a
limb to say monitor only,? said Radford. </p>

<p>Radford says at this point she relies
on the standard of care to ensure her patients have the best possible outcome.</p>

<p>?I offer standard of care per NCCN
[National Comprehensive Cancer Network] guidelines or Cleveland Clinic Care
Paths,? she continued. If a patient?s health means they cannot receive the
recommended standard of care ?a multidisciplinary team approach should occur.
In general, if a patient refused surgery they should be followed closely with
physical exams and regular breast imaging, if they agree to return for follow-up.?</p>

<p>Agnese believes age is an important
consideration when debating treatment options.</p>

<p>?In a woman at 70 years old with a
small breast cancer, the likelihood is that she will die of something else over
the next 20 years,? she explained.</p>

<p>However, she pointed out that nothing
is guaranteed in cancer treatment, and that cancers that have a good outlook
can still become metastatic. </p>

<p>?It?s not an exact science, as much as
we would like it to be,? said Agnese. ?To watch and do nothing at all is not
currently done. Nobody wants to be the doctor who didn?t treat and then it
spreads and leads to death.?</p>




<h2>Monitoring
other cancers</h2>

<p>?When
it comes to breast cancer, this is a very controversial topic,? said Dr. Jack
Jacoub, medical oncologist, and director of thoracic oncology at <a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/" target="_blank">MemorialCare Cancer
Institute</a> at
Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California. </p>

<p>Jacoub
pointed out that from a medical oncology standpoint there are many scenarios
where they advise individuals to engage in watchful waiting. </p>

<p>?There?s
an understanding that early intervention doesn?t necessarily correlate with
improved outcomes,? Jacoub said. ?And if we intervene now, it probably won?t
make a difference in the overall picture, when we consider life span and
morbidity.? </p>

<p>He
said low-grade lymphoma is the most common scenario where cancer specialists
are dealing with this observation option. </p>

<p>?Untreated,
it can go many years without harming the patient or shortening the
cancer-specific life span. For this type, chemotherapy and other therapies may
be extreme,? said Jacoub. ?If there are symptoms or it changes to a more
aggressive course, we would intervene and the patient hasn?t lost anything.?</p>

<p>However,
simply watching and waiting can be difficult for patients to accept.</p>

<p>?There
is data, and there is a prevailing opinion in the western world, specifically
the United States, that patients often don?t opt for the observation route,?
Jacoub said. ?It?s hard for patients and their families to accept watchful
waiting, particularly younger, healthier individuals.?</p>

<p>According
to Jacoub, there?s an abundance of information to support a watchful waiting
approach to some types of prostate cancer. </p>

<p>Indeed,
a 2016 <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606220" target="_blank">study</a> published in the NEJM compared
active monitoring with surgical treatment called radical prostatectomy and
external-beam radiotherapy to see how they affected patients with localized
prostate cancer. </p>

<p>The
research involved 82,429 men aged 50 to 69 who had a diagnosis of localized
prostate cancer. They looked at patient mortality at a median of 10 years at
follow-up. In addition, they also looked at secondary outcomes, which included
the rates of disease progression, metastases, and deaths from any cause.</p>

<p>The
mortality rate from prostate cancer specifically was low, no matter what
treatment was given. But surgery and radiotherapy treatments were associated
with fewer incidences of disease progression and metastases, when compared to
active monitoring.</p>




<h2>The human element</h2>

<p>While
some patients want to pursue more treatment than is needed, others prefer waiting
and watching. </p>

<p>But
when active surveillance is an option, there?s a lot riding on the patient being
compliant with doctor?s orders.</p>

<p>Jacoub
uses the example of young men with testicular cancer, which is often highly
curable, to illustrate the fickle nature of patient compliance.</p>

<p>?In
the earlier stage [of disease] you could probably avoid therapy [via
chemotherapy or radiation] after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence,?
Jacoub said. ?Why give those young men chemotherapy or radiation??</p>

<p>He
continued that if doctors and patients work together they can spot reoccurrence
early. </p>

<p>?If
it recurred, you could intervene and cure rate would not change,? Jacoub
explained. ?This surveillance option is appropriate and supported.?</p>

<p>However,
this surveillance can be more complicated when the human element comes in. </p>

<p>?Their
surveillance schedule should be very strict for up to 10 years,? said Jacoub. ?In
that age group, patients may go away to school or relocate for work. How likely
is it that they?ll follow up? You have to know who you?re dealing with and
consider the person?s whole picture.?</p>

<p>In
women, deciding to treat breast cancer can be complicated especially since the
disease will strike both young and middle-age women. While a woman in her 70s
with a slow-growing tumor may be more likely to die of other causes in her
lifetime, a young woman with the same tumor may need more invasive treatment to
stop the cancer from becoming deadly. </p>

<p>?That
should give you pause. This is not an elderly, unwell group,? said Jacoub. ?Even
if there is an excellent prognosis with, as with early-stage endocrine
sensitive breast cancer, it?s not 100 percent.?</p>

<p>Jacoub
emphasized that doctors have to take the long view in treating the patient.</p>

<p>?You
can have a late recurrence even 20 or 30 years later,? Jacoub explained. ?It?s
a big problem and can be incurable at that junction. You have to be careful
about undertreating.?</p>

<p>Monitoring
comes with another set of problems, including stress on the patient and family.</p>

<p>?She?ll
need frequent imaging, and the radiologist reading that image will be very
critical in scrutinizing it ? it?s just not that easy,? Jacoub said. ?Even
women with benign breast disease will come in having had multiple biopsies and
are thinking about having their breasts removed. We don?t advise that, but it?s
understandable. Imagine living under that kind of cloud for years.?</p>

<p>If
breast cancer does progress, Jacoub says treatment can become a labyrinth of
chemotherapy, pills, radiation, and office visits. That risk can make treatments
over surveillance look more appealing for doctors and patients. </p>

<p>?There?s
a common sense approach,? said Jacoub. ?We have to separate the science and the
numbers and look at the person. What will it do to their life??</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-21T15:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-21T15:00:00</updateddate><category>Cancer</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/monitoring-tumor-is-sometimes-better-than-aggressive-treatment</guid><dc:date>2017-06-21T15:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Millennial Doctors, Patients Shaping Healthcare World</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/millennial-doctors-and-patients-shaping-healthcare </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Millennials
have been bringing new ideas and ways of doing things to many workplaces for at
least a decade now. </p>

<p>But
the impact of this generation ? born between 1982 and 2000 ? is just now being
felt in healthcare as younger physicians finish their medical training in their
early to mid 30s, and as millennials leave their parents? health insurance.</p>

<p>Of
course, not every millennial physician or patient is the same. And there?s a
lot of overlap between generations.</p>

<p>But
some people see trends emerging as this tech-savvy generation shapes the
healthcare world.</p>



<h2>Work-life balance for doctors</h2>

<p><a href="https://wire.ama-assn.org/life-career/report-reveals-severity-burnout-specialty" target="_blank">Burnout</a> has long been a problem among
doctors. But for many millennial physicians, finding a good balance between
work and their personal lives is just as important as job satisfaction.</p>

<p>?Decreasing
the number of hours in the hospital or in the clinic in order to do things
outside of work that are enjoyable ? extracurricular activities, hobbies, those
sorts of things ? is increasingly important to my generation of physicians,?
Dr. Ryan Kruse, a millennial physical medicine and rehabilitation resident
physician at the Mayo Clinic, told Healthline. </p>

<p>Kurt
Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances at <a href="https://www.merritthawkins.com/" target="_blank">Merritt
Hawkins</a>
health consultants, has seen this desire for more reasonable work hours grow in
recent years.</p>

<p>?Back
when I started, the question doctors always had when they were looking at
relocating, it was like real estate ? it was location, location, location,?
Mosley told Healthline. ?Now with millennials, their question is lifestyle,
lifestyle, lifestyle.?</p>

<p>This
may translate to millennials working part-time right out of their training.</p>

<p>?We
have a lot of doctors that do practice sharing ? two doctors have one
practice,? said Mosley. </p>

<p>In
this type of practice, each doctor may only work two-and-a-half days each week.
This comes with a lower salary, but for some, this is a reasonable trade-off.</p>

<p>Other
millennial physicians seeking work-life balance may join nontraditional
practices like <a href="https://www.plushcare.com/" target="_blank">PlushCare</a>, an online urgent care provider
that offers both patients and doctors a new approach to healthcare.</p>

<p>This
telemedicine-only company allows people to talk to doctors from the comfort of
their own homes or workplaces. </p>

<p>Doctors
also benefit from this model.</p>

<p>?Doctors
have never been able to work from home before in any capacity. So the ability
to have a flexible schedule and see patients from their home office is
something that really appeals to them,? millennial physician Dr. James Wantuck,
co-founder and chief medical officer of PlushCare, told Healthline.</p>

<p>In
spite of the millennial-friendly approach, it appeals to older people. The
average age of the people who use the company?s services is 39. And its doctors
range in age from 28 to over 65.</p>

<h2>Savvy with technology</h2>

<p>Although
some <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1797" target="_blank">studies</a> have looked at the quality of
care provided by doctors of different ages, Wantuck only sees ?slight
generational differences? in how his colleagues practice medicine.</p>

<p>But
he and others have noticed a shift in recent years away from the
doctor-as-parent attitude, in which a physician makes a diagnosis, comes up
with a treatment plan, and the patient is expected to follow through, no
questions asked.</p>

<p>In
contrast, doctors today may present patients with several potential treatment
plans.</p>

<p>?The
decision regarding which treatment option to pursue is a joint decision made
between physician and patient,? said Kruse.</p>

<p>This
change may be driven more by medical education than the nature of millennials themselves,
but this kind of ?cooperative relationship with patients? is the norm for this
generation of doctors.</p>

<p>Technology
is another factor that is shaping healthcare. Not just in how doctors diagnose
and treat patients, but also in how they communicate with patients and manage
their medical records.</p>

<p>Having
grown up with computers, cell phones, and the internet, many millennial physicians
have an advantage over earlier generations of doctors.</p>

<p>?Among
younger physicians that I have been around, these new technologies are learned
rather quickly,? said Kruse, ?and I would say it?s pretty ubiquitous that
younger physicians are well-versed in technology.?</p>

<p>This
is evident when it comes to how doctors of different generations approach
electronic health records.</p>

<p>Mosley
mentioned an older doctor who had recruited a millennial. The younger doctor
came into the practice and announced he was going to make the whole office
paperless.</p>

<p>The
older doctor looked his new colleague ?right in the eye? and said, ?You?re a
great doctor, I really admire your skills, but this office is going to be
paperless when the restroom is paperless.?</p>

<p>In
spite of that, Mosley said these two doctors ?seem to be getting along.?</p>

<p>Millennial
patients also appreciate when doctors go paperless.</p>

<p>Adam
Powell, a millennial patient and president of the healthcare consulting firm <a href="http://payerprovider.com/" target="_blank">Payer+Provider Syndicate</a>, finds that electronic medical
records can add to the ?value of patient visits? ? providing him with access to
lab results and a long-term record of his health, and heading off potential
problems early.</p>

<p>?My
physician recently alerted me that my vaccines were about to become out-of-date,?
he said.</p>

<p>Although
millennial physicians may push for more technology in the clinic, when it comes
to the practice of medicine, the relationship between new doctors and their
older peers remains solid.</p>

<p>?It
seems like the traditionalists ? which is our oldest doctors, those over 65 ?
are really pairing up with young millennials,? said Mosley.</p>

<p>There
are, of course, drawbacks to embracing technology too much, whether it?s driven
by millennials or the medical profession overall.</p>

<p>A
2013 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-013-2376-6" target="_blank">study</a> in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, showed that medical
interns spent only 12 percent of their time on direct patient care, compared
with 40 percent working on the computer.</p>



<h2>Online communication</h2>

<p>Even
for many millennial patients, technology in medicine just makes sense. But it?s
also becoming more of a cross-generational phenomenon.</p>

<p>?As millennials,
we?re much more comfortable with text-based communication or video chat or
email,? said Wantuck. ?But I think older people are moving towards those
methods of communication, as well.?</p>

<p>Younger
patients especially may not always see the need for face-to-face contact with
their doctor.</p>

<p>?I
would prefer to have some medical professional answer simple questions by
direct message,? said millennial Maeghan Nicholson, director of marketing for
the healthcare technology company <a href="http://www.wellbe.me/" target="_blank">Wellbe,
Inc.</a> ?For
instance, I wrote in through my patient portal this week to ask them what my
blood type was.?</p>

<p>Doctors?
offices that shun technology risk losing millennials? business.</p>

<p>?I
can research, plan, and book a 10-day trip to Hawaii from my couch without ever
talking to a single person,? said Nicholson. </p>

<p>?So
why do I have to spend at least two hours out of my day waiting on hold to
schedule an appointment, driving to the doctor, sitting in a waiting room, and
wasting my time to get a prescription for what I already know is a simple
diagnosis for one of my kids ? like pinkeye ? when this transaction could be
easily done online by submitting a picture??</p>

<p>Not
every millennial, though, is convinced.</p>

<p>?I
would like the doctor to have electronic medical records, but it is not a deal
breaker for me,? Christina Noce, a millennial from West Palm Beach, Fla., told
Healthline.</p>

<p>But
she added, ?My doctor does not offer FaceTime options and I wish he did. There
is no reason my doctor needs to see me every few months to give me the same
thyroid dosage I have been on for years.?</p>

<h2>On-demand healthcare</h2>

<p>When
it comes to visiting the doctor, many millennials crave the same kind of
on-demand service that they get with music, movies, and food delivery.</p>

<p>?Millennials
want it all and they want it right now,? said Mosley. ?They want to be fixed
and on their way.?</p>

<p>This
may mean gravitating to healthcare companies that offer urgent care in a new
way, like PlushCare?s telemedicine or <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/" target="_blank">ZocDoc?s</a> online booking for in-person
appointments.</p>

<p>?When
urgent access is needed and my regular healthcare providers are not available,
I have ventured onto ZocDoc to find short-term assistance,? said Powell.</p>

<p>Noce
said that she would even be willing to pay more for a doctor visit if she
?needed immediate attention,? but she ?would rather wait and go to a doctor
that costs less.?</p>

<p>Desire
for quicker access to healthcare is not unique to millennials, but this group
may be pushing medicine in new directions.</p>

<p>?I
don?t think anyone ever enjoys sitting in a doctor?s office for an hour waiting
for their appointment to start,? said Wantuck. ?But millennials may be more
willing to do something about it, and more willing to try something new.?</p>

<p>Millennials
are also known for resisting the government?s attempts to convince them to sign
up for health insurance through <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-millennial-problem-229071" target="_blank">Obamacare</a>.</p>

<p>They
may take an on-demand approach to insurance, as well.</p>

<p>?A
lot of [millennials] don?t have insurance,? said Mosley. ?And if something
serious happens, then they get insurance.?</p>

<p>Even
when healthy millennials sign up for insurance, they may opt for a
high-deductible plan in order to reduce their monthly premiums. But this means
their insurance may not cover many medical expenses until they have a major ?
and expensive ? health problem.</p>

<p>Lack
of insurance ? or a comprehensive plan ? can make millennials more
cost-conscious about doctor?s visits and medical procedures. </p>

<p>?I
wish it was easier to get a straight answer about how much the final bill will be
so I can prepare,? said Noce. ?This never happens. I constantly get the runaround.?</p>

<p>As
patients crave more up front transparency ? like you have when you shop online
for everything else ? companies like PlushCare are responding.</p>

<p>?You
put your insurance information in and you know instantaneously what the cost of
the consultation?s going to be,? said Wantuck. ?You?re not going to get a bill
three months down the road.?</p>

<p>Although
millennial doctors and patients may be different from previous generations in some
ways, Mosley emphasized that overall it?s ?not good or bad.?</p>

<p>This
is, however, a unique time for medicine.</p>

<p>?We?ve
never had four different established age groups in healthcare,? said Mosley.
?You have millennials. You have Gen X. You have baby boomers. You have traditionalists.
All working together.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-21T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-21T14:00:00</updateddate><category>General Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/millennial-doctors-and-patients-shaping-healthcare</guid><dc:date>2017-06-21T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Amid Senate Secrecy, Experts Weigh in on New Healthcare Bill</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/experts-weigh-in-on-new-healthcare-bill </link><description><![CDATA[<p>With
multiple reports that the Senate will present their version of a healthcare
bill, dubbed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), in the coming days, experts,
patients, and other groups that will be affected by the bill are anxiously waiting
to see what is in it. </p>

<p>It?s been over a month since the U.S. House
of Representatives passed their version of a healthcare bill designed to
replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ? also known as Obamacare ? and the new
version of the bill crafted in the Senate remains a mystery. </p>

<p>Nadereh
Pourat, PhD, director
at the Center of Health Policy Research at the University
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said if the Senate version of the health
bill remains similar to the house bill, it means a ?repeal? of the ACA ?plain
and simple.? </p>

<p>?It?s
about undoing Obamacare or ACA in one way or another,? Pourat told Healthline.
?The first draft that came out of the House did that exactly. The Senate
version from what you see appear in the media is not going to be very different
in its purpose.? </p>

<p>A recent <a href="http://news.patientslikeme.com/press-release/patientslikeme-poll-reveals-must-haves-health-care-law" target="_blank">PatientsLikeMe</a><strong> </strong>poll taken in
January surveyed 2,755<strong> </strong>people living with chronic
conditions in all 50 states. The poll revealed these people are increasingly in
favor of modifying rather than replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with 62
percent reporting the ACA needs minor modifications or is working well. </p>

<p>?Despite the partisan divide in Congress
about what should be included in a healthcare plan, there is a singular voice
in<strong> </strong>patients,
who are agreed across party lines on the essential foundation for any plan,?
Sally Okun, PatientsLikeMe?s vice president of advocacy, policy, and<strong> </strong>patient<strong> </strong>safety, said in a statement. </p>

<p>While the House version of the bill was <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52752" target="_blank">estimated
by the Congressional Budget Office</a> to reduce the deficit by $119 billion over
the coming decade, an estimated 23
million would be without healthcare in 2026 compared with estimates for the
ACA. </p>

<p>However, little is known about the health
bill currently being written in the Senate, so leading experts, patients, and other
groups wait to see what will be released. </p>






<h2>Tax credit changes</h2>

<p>Christine Eibner, PhD, senior economist, and a professor at Pardee RAND
Graduate School, said she is particularly focused on how tax credits will be
changed and if they will differ from the House version of the bill. </p>

<p>Under the ACA, credits are
given to individuals based mainly on family income, cost of insurance, and age.
In the new health bill that passed the House, a flat tax would be given based
mainly on age, and capped for people earning over a certain amount. </p>

<p>The bill passed by the House
would provide tax credits between $2,000 up to $14,000 for individuals to help
pay for insurance coverage if they don?t receive insurance from their employers.
</p>

<p>?I want to see what happens with
the tax credits in the individual market,? Eibner told Healthline. ?It was
widely pointed out that the tax credits were not as generous as the ACA? for
certain groups.</p>

<p>Eibner said that she?s seen ?a lot of
discussion of will the Senate,? change how these credits are divvied up. However,
no details about the bill have been released yet. </p>

<p>According to an <a href="http://www.kff.org/interactive/tax-credits-under-the-affordable-care-act-vs-replacement-proposal-interactive-map/" target="_blank">analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, people who
are older, have lower incomes, and live in areas where there are high insurance
premiums are more likely to receive less in tax credits under the current AHCA
bill passed by the house. </p>

<p>On the flip side, younger
people with higher incomes will likely get more in tax credits than they do
currently. </p>

<p>In a public letter
addressed to the Senate, AARP Executive Vice President, Nancy LeaMond, cited
concerns about the bill and its potential effect on older Americans. She
highlighted changes in tax credits as one way seniors would likely have to pay
more in premiums. </p>

<p>She also pointed out that under
the House bill, insurance companies could charge far more for a plan covering an
older American compared with a younger person. Under the ACA, insurance
companies could only charge three times the amount (a 3-to-1 age rating), and
under the new plan they could charge five times the amount. </p>

<p>?Taken together, the
bill?s tax credit changes and a 5:1 age rating would result in skyrocketing
cost increases for older Americans,? LeaMond wrote. </p>






<h2>Preexisting conditions</h2>

<p>Eibner said she also wanted to see if the Senate
will keep or get rid of a provision that could weaken protections for people
with preexisting conditions. </p>

<p>In this provision states could apply for
waivers that would exempt insurance companies from the ?community rating.? This
community rating provision implemented in the ACA is used to spread the cost of
care across a larger pool. As a result of this requirement, people could not be
charged a higher rate due to their health status. </p>

<p>Currently the ACA premiums are based on a
person?s age, location, number of people covered on a health plan, and if the
people covered use tobacco ? not their health status. </p>

<p>If states apply for waivers to bypass the
community rating, insurance companies could potentially charge far more if a
person has an underlying health condition. </p>

<p>?That could lead to de facto differences? in
costs for healthy and sick people, Eibner said. ?If you're healthy person you?d
get a lower premium.?</p>

<p>To qualify for a waiver, states would have to
provide another way for these people to get care, most likely through a high-risk
pool. </p>

<p>LeaMond pointed out that removing financial
protections around preexisting conditions could mean a significant portion of
older American?s could risk losing health coverage. </p>

<p>?The AHCA would remove preexisting condition
protections and once again allow insurance companies to charge Americans more ?
we estimate up to $25,000 more ? due to a preexisting condition,? LeaMond
wrote. AARP estimates that about 25 million people, or 40 percent of people 50-64
years of age could be at risk for losing coverage due to this change. </p>

<p>All of these changes could severely impact
how much older Americans pay in premiums. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/hr1628aspassed.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Congressional Budget
Office, a 64-year-old making $26,500 per year could have their premiums go up
from $1,700 a year to as much as $16,100, depending on if their state applies
for a waiver. </p>

<p>If a 64-year-old is making over $68,200,
their premiums may go down slightly from $15,300 to 13,600, or up slightly to
$16,100 depending on if their state receives a waiver. </p>





<h2>Essential
health benefits</h2>

<p>Another major change under the AHCA would be a
provision that could weaken the essential health benefits requirement. </p>

<p>This provision would allow states to apply
for a waiver so that insurance companies based in that state would not be
required to cover all of the 10 essential health benefits that are currently
mandated under Obamacare. </p>

<p>These essential health benefits were required
to guarantee that people had robust coverage under all insurance plans and
include benefits like prescriptions, mental health, and maternal care. </p>

<p>As a result of this provision, insurance
plans may be far cheaper, but could leave people with serious gaps in their
coverage if, for example, they don?t sign up for maternal health coverage and
then become pregnant. </p>

<p>?A
few million people will purchase something with their tax credit, but it
wouldn't be good enough to be considered insurance,? Eibner said.</p>

<h2>Changes
to Medicaid</h2>

<p>Under the AHCA, Medicaid would be turned from
an open-ended per capita program ? where the federal government gives states
money based on need ? to a block grant program where states would have a set
amount of federal funds to pay for their programs. </p>

<p>Pourat pointed out that these changes could massively
affect access to healthcare in this country. </p>

<p>These caps will ?limit how much the state
will get. In other words, it doesn't matter if there is widespread recession and
incomes go down and people lose their jobs,? Pourat said. ?The states, if they
want to cover everyone, they'll have to do it with their own state funds,?
after they get a set amount of Medicaid funds from the federal government. </p>

<p>AARP has issued <a href="http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/politics/advocacy/2017/05/senate-letter-ahca-5-15-17-11rp.pdf" target="_blank">concerns</a> about the changes to Medicaid,
reporting that the GOP-crafted health bill would lead to a 25 percent reduction,
or a cut of $839 billion, over 2017-2026. </p>

<p>?We are concerned that these provisions would
result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both ? endangering the
health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential
services provided through Medicaid,? LeaMond wrote in the letter addressed to
senators. </p>

<p>Additionally, Medicaid expansion would be
rolled back over time, starting in 2020. This expansion, which depended on
states opting into the program, allowed people making no more than 133 percent
of the federal poverty level to qualify for Medicaid. The federal government
paid 90 percent of the costs for these patients. </p>

<p>These cuts could greatly impact older
Americans, even those that qualify for Medicare. AARP estimates that among the
17.9 million people on Medicaid about 6.9 million are over age 65. </p>

<p>?Older adults and people with disabilities
now account for approximately sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and cuts of
this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and services for this vulnerable
population,? LeaMond wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-21T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-21T14:00:00</updateddate><category>Health Insurance Exchanges,Public Policy</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/experts-weigh-in-on-new-healthcare-bill</guid><dc:date>2017-06-21T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Prozac Improves Autism Traits in Mouse Model</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/prozac-improves-autism-traits-in-mouse-model </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers found
that Prozac, given during development, can reduce autism-like traits in mouse
models of the disorder.</p>



<p>Symptoms of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) are varied but often include difficulty with socializing and exhibiting
repetitive behaviors.</p>



<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6503a1.htm" target="_blank">1 in 68 children</a> is diagnosed with ASD in the United States.
Worryingly, the number of diagnoses made is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html" target="_blank">steadily rising</a>.</p>



<p>Despite its
prevalence, the exact causes of ASD are not yet known. Because of this,
treatment options are also severely lacking.</p>



<p>New research
carried out at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan set out to
investigate the role of serotonin in the development of ASD. Led by Toru
Takumi, the work is published this week in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>




<p>Genes, serotonin, and autism</p>



<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0025846/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=" target="_blank">Recent
work</a> has shown that
individuals with ASD have a high number of genomic mutations across a range of
genes. Using this knowledge, Takumi?s group designed a mouse model of ASD by
duplicating one of the most common copy variations.</p>

<p>The resulting mice displayed
some of the characteristics of ASD in humans, such as behavioral inflexibility
and poor social interaction. Interestingly, these mice had lower levels of
serotonin in their brains during development ? something that has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4370364/" target="_blank">also
been demonstrated</a> in
humans with ASD.</p>



<p>?Although
abnormalities in the serotonin system have been thought to be part of the ASD
pathophysiology, the functional impact of serotonin deficiency in ASD was
totally unknown,? said <em>Takumi.</em></p>



<p>In their study, the
Japanese team wanted to understand how lower levels of serotonin can affect the
behavior of neurons and the impact that this has on behavior.</p>



<p>Firstly, the team
demonstrated that the neurons in the brain area with highest serotonin levels
were less active than in normal, control mice. Next, they studied the region of
the brain that receives neurons from these particular serotonergic neurons.</p>



<p>Individuals with
ASD are known to have abnormal responses in the sensory regions of their brain.
Takumi and his team found similar discrepancies in the part of the mouse brain
that deals with whisker movements.</p>



<p>In the ASD mouse
model, rather than whisker movements being confined to discrete areas, they
were spread more liberally across the sensory cortex. This overlapping of
regions means that it would be harder to distinguish sensations.</p>


<p>The team presumed
that, because there was activity in normally inactive neurons, there may be
reduced inhibition. The team confirmed this theory; they found that there were
?fewer inhibitory synapses? and less frequent inhibitory inputs to the sensory
area.</p>



<p>This discovery led
to the next phase of the experiment. As first author Nobuhiro Nakai explains, ?Because
the sensory region was receiving abnormally low serotonin input, we reasoned
that giving infant mice serotonin therapy might reduce the imbalance and also
rescue some of the behavioral abnormalities.?</p>







<p>Does increased serotonin alter ASD behavior?</p>



<p>To answer this
question, the researchers used a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
called fluoxetine, which is also known as Prozac. SSRIs are common drugs used
to treat depression and anxiety disorders. </p>



<p>They gave Prozac to
the mice 3 weeks after birth, a point in time when serotonin is known to be
reduced in the mouse model. Sensory neurons in the mice treated with SSRIs did,
as expected, exhibit <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2017-06/r-sis061617.php" target="_blank">more
normal inhibitory responses</a>.</p>



<p>Once the
inhibitory/excitatory balance had been brought back in line, the team tested to
see whether or not the mice?s behavior would also change in line. </p>



<p>To examine this,
they gave the mice a choice of spending time near an empty cage, or near a cage
that housed an unknown mouse. Normally, mice choose to spend more time next to a
cage with an unknown rodent. ASD model mice, however, choose to spend time next
to the empty cage. </p>


<p>The ASD mice given
Prozac during development chose to spend more time close to the unknown mouse.
Also, ASD mouse pups produced more vocalizations, which is a measure of
anxiety, while those given Prozac did not.</p>


<p>The findings may
offer a new avenue of research into ASD and potential treatments. Of course,
there will need to be much more research, as Takumi explains:</p>


<p>?Our genetic model
for ASD is one of many, and because the number of genetic mutations associated
with ASD is so high, we need to investigate differences and common mechanisms
among multiple genetic ASD models. Additionally, before we can administrate
SSRIs to patients with ASD, we must study the effects of SSRIs in more detail,
especially because adverse effects have been reported in some animal studies.?</p>


<p>Although the hunt
for ASD treatments will be ongoing for many years to come, the current findings
offer fresh hope.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-21T13:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-21T13:00:00</updateddate><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/prozac-improves-autism-traits-in-mouse-model</guid><dc:date>2017-06-21T13:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Is a Single-Payer Health System Too Expensive to Be a Realistic Option?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-single-payer-health-system-too-expensive </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Some
California politicians are hoping to accomplish something that Congress has
failed to do ? provide publicly-funded universal health care to all residents
of the state.</p>

<p>This
ambitious plan, though, has left many people reeling from sticker shock.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-first-fiscal-analysis-of-single-payer-1495475434-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">analysis</a> last month
by the state?s Senate Appropriations Committee estimated that a single-payer
healthcare system in the state would cost $400 billion a year.</p>

<p>Under bill <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562" target="_blank">SB 562</a>, the state would cover
the costs of medical care for all residents of California ? including people
without legal status.</p>

<p>This includes inpatient, outpatient, emergency services,
mental health, nursing home care, dental, and vision. There would be no
premiums, copays, or deductibles. </p>

<p>Around half of the money needed could come from existing
federal, state, and local funds currently spent on healthcare. But the state
would still have to find an additional $200 billion per year to fund this
single-payer system.</p>

<p>A later <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-single-payer-bill-20170605-story.html" target="_blank">study</a> paid for by the
California Nurses Association/National Nurses United ? supporters of the new
bill ? estimated a total annual cost of $331 billion.</p>

<p>Either way, this is no small deal ? it is twice the
entire state budget proposed for the next fiscal year by Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>



<h2>Paying for universal
healthcare</h2>

<p>Lawmakers
have not decided on a way to pay for the new plan. But the analysis suggests that a 15 percent payroll tax on earned income would cover the increased costs.</p>

<p>Many
have balked at the thought of new taxes. </p>

<p>However,
the analysis points out that a single-payer system would reduce healthcare
spending by employers and employees in the state, which is currently between
$100 and $150 billion per year. And residents would no longer have to pay
out-of-pocket for most of their healthcare.</p>

<p>According
to the <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2016/oct/slowdown-in-employer-insurance-cost-growth" target="_blank">Commonwealth Fund</a>, in 2015 annual family health insurance
premiums in the United States averaged $17,322. California was slightly higher
at $18,045.</p>

<p>People
with employer health insurance policies paid 21 percent of this, on average.
The rest of the cost was picked up by employers.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/report-consumers-out-of-pocket-medical-expenses-rising-042717.html" target="_blank">report</a> by healthcare market research publisher
Kalorama Information found that in 2016, individuals spent an average of $1,400
out-of-pocket for health services.</p>

<p>A 15
percent payroll tax on someone making $60,000 per year would be $9,000. If this
was split between employees and employer in the same way that health insurance
premiums are now, employees may not feel much of a difference.</p>

<p>The
analysis points out, though, that there are many unanswered questions.</p>

<p>?There
is tremendous uncertainty in how such a system would be developed, how the
transition to the new system would occur, and how participants in the new
system would behave,? it noted.</p>



<h2>Looking to other countries</h2>

<p>Many
other countries have versions of universal healthcare ? or Medicare for All, as
it?s sometimes known in the United States. These countries offer some hint as
to how a California single-payer system might fare.</p>

<p>California
has a population of 39 million, roughly the same as the 36 million in Canada,
which has a publicly-funded universal healthcare system. </p>

<p>Canada
doesn?t have a single national plan. Instead, each Canadian province and
territory has its own health insurance program, with funding coming from the
federal government.</p>

<p>In
2016 Canada spent $228 billion on <a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en/health-spending" target="_blank">healthcare</a>. This comes out to $6,299 per person, or 11
percent of the country?s gross domestic product (GDP).</p>

<p>The
average life expectancy in Canada in 2015 was 82.2 years, according to the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>.</p>

<p>With
a $400 billion price tag, the California single-payer health plan would cost on
average $10,191 per person ? more than one-and-a-half times what Canadians
spend. This is around 15 percent of California?s GDP.</p>

<p>California?s
<a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">life expectancy</a> was 80.8 years in 2009. The average <a href="https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html" target="_blank">U.S. life span</a> is 79.8 years.</p>

<h2>Will single-payer work?</h2>

<p>The
cost of healthcare for all has been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to
national efforts to implement this kind of program in the United States.</p>

<p>Advocates
of single-payer health systems counter that expanding coverage to everyone
would reduce administrative costs and profits inherent in the current public-private
arrangement in the United States.</p>

<p>In a
<a href="http://annals.org/aim/article/2605414/single-payer-reform-only-way-fulfill-president-s-pledge-more" target="_blank">study</a> earlier this year in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers
?estimate that single-payer reform could save approximately $504 billion
annually on bureaucracy.?</p>

<p>They
also point out that hospital administrative costs in Canada and Scotland are
around 12 percent of their revenue. In the United States they are over 25
percent.</p>

<p>Another
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1662.html" target="_blank">study</a> this year by RAND looked at various health
insurance options for Oregon.</p>

<p>Researchers
estimated that if a single-payer option were implemented in the state, every
resident would have health insurance. Universal coverage would be especially
beneficial to people with low to middle incomes.</p>

<p>Healthcare
costs would remain largely unchanged. However, this would require cuts to
provider payment rates, which might drive providers out of the state. In the
end, this could worsen access to care.</p>

<p>Increasing
health insurance coverage and access to quality healthcare is only one part of
the equation. Another is the high cost of healthcare.</p>

<p>Overall,
the United States <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/20/524774195/what-country-spends-the-most-and-least-on-health-care-per-person" target="_blank">spends more on healthcare</a> than other high-income
countries, but this doesn?t translate into longer life spans for all Americans.</p>

<p>A
single-payer system may not immediately lower those costs, or address lifestyle
factors like poor diet and lack of exercise that can lead to chronic diseases
like obesity and heart disease.</p>

<p>These
diseases lower life expectancy in the United States, but they also account for
a large share of healthcare costs.</p>

<p>According
to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the costs in 2010 for heart
disease and stroke alone were estimated to be $315.4 billion. The costs linked
to obesity in 2008 were estimated at $147 billion.</p>

<p>There?s
no guarantee that a single-payer system in California will solve all of these
issues.</p>

<p>But
if the state were able to pull it off, it will give health policy researchers
more data to show what might work ? and what doesn?t ? in a country that has
long resisted the worldwide universal healthcare trend.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-21T13:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-21T13:00:00</updateddate><category>Public Policy</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-single-payer-health-system-too-expensive</guid><dc:date>2017-06-21T13:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Heat Wave Hazards Include 3rd Degree Burns, Docs Warn</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/heatwave-hazards-include-third-degree-burns-docs-warn </link><description><![CDATA[<p>On
the first day of summer, the Southwest region of the United States is expected
to swelter, with some regions experiencing temperatures over 120캟 (49캜). To keep residents safe, officials
are warning of the health dangers associated with the extreme heat. </p>

<p>The
National Weather Service (NOAA) has issued an ?excessive heat warning? for Las
Vegas and nearby areas through June 23. </p>

<p>In
the Las Vegas Valley, the high temperatures are expected to reach 117캟 (47캜), while in Death Valley and the
Colorado River Valley the mercury is expected to pass 120캟 (49캜). </p>

<p>?A prolonged period of near record-to-record heat will
create a dangerous situation in which heat illnesses are likely ? especially
for the elderly, children, homeless, those unaccustomed to the heat, and those
that do not take proper precautions,? NOAA <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NVZ020&amp;warncounty=NVC003&amp;firewxzone=NVZ465&amp;local_place1=Las%20Vegas%20NV&amp;product1=Excessive+Heat+Warning&amp;lat=36.175&amp;lon=-115.1372#.WUl9UhMrJ-U" target="_blank">officials
noted</a> in the warning. </p>



<h2>Extreme weather and extreme
consequences</h2>

<p>Heat waves are especially deadly in the United
States where they account for most weather-related deaths, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/ClimateChangeandExtremeHeatEvents.pdf" target="_blank">U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. </p>

<p>?From 1999 through 2009, extreme heat exposure
caused or contributed to more than 7,800 deaths in the United States,? the CDC reported.</p>

<p>A single
heat wave can result in hundreds or even thousands of deaths. In 1995, a heat
wave in Chicago was estimated to have caused at least 650 deaths. And in 2003,
a heat wave left 14,800 dead in France, according to the CDC. </p>

<p>In the
Southwest, where the heat is so intense that airlines have
reportedly <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/20/theres-a-scientific-reason-why-hot-weather-has-grounded-planes-at-phoenix-airport.html" target="_blank">grounded flights</a>, doctors have warned that the
extreme temperatures can lead to unexpected injuries like second and third
degree burns. </p>





<p>Dr. Kevin Foster, of the Arizona Burn Center, said in a <a href="http://www.mihs.org/article/arizona-burn-center-issues-warning-about-dangers-of-excessive-heat" target="_blank">statement</a> that asphalt, concrete, and
playground equipment can cause serious burns. </p>

<p>?Young children are particularly vulnerable,? Foster said. ?Not only is
their skin more sensitive, but they haven?t learned how to remove themselves
from the hot surface or object. Though they might be uncomfortable on the hot
surface, they don?t understand why they are hurting or that they need to move.?
</p>

<p>Foster warned that even the interior of a car could be dangerous for
children to touch when temperatures outside exceed 100캟 (38캜).</p>

<p>The Southern Nevada Health District is warning residents to take steps
to protect themselves. While under normal conditions the body can cool itself
naturally via sweat, the district <a href="http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/health-topics/heat-health-concern.php" target="_blank">points out</a> that ?extreme
heat causes the evaporation process to slow and the body to work harder to
maintain a normal temperature.?<a href="/health/summer-SAD-is-all-too-real"></a></p>

<p>Those most
at risk include people over the age 65, and children, whose bodies are not very
adept at regulating temperature. Additionally, people who are overweight, on
certain medications, and who live in cities where temperatures can be warmer
are also at increased risk. </p>

<h2>Warning signs of heat
exhaustion and heat stroke</h2>

<p>The
high temperatures can cause a host of injuries from somewhat minor symptoms
such as heat cramps and rashes, to more serious conditions like heat exhaustion
and heat stroke. </p>

<p>Symptoms
of heat exhaustion, which occur when the body loses an excessive amount of
water and salt via sweat, include tiredness, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, and
dizziness. </p>





<p>While
heat exhaustion and heat stroke are two separate conditions, they are related.
Heat exhaustion can be a precursor to heat stroke, which occurs when the body?s
temperature quickly rises, and the sweat mechanism designed to cool the body
falters. </p>

<p>This
condition can result in serious symptoms like a throbbing
headache, dizziness, nausea, and a rapid, strong pulse. It can be life-threatening
for people who don?t seek treatment quickly. </p>

<p>Should
a person appear to have heat stroke, the Southern Nevada Health District
advises calling an emergency line, using wet towels and fans to cool the
person, and putting them in shade or a cool shower. They do not advise giving
fluids. </p>





<p>Understanding
how to stay safe in a heat wave will increasingly become important, according
to the CDC. </p>

<p>?Experts
project that as our climate changes, extreme heat events in the United States
will become more frequent, longer lasting, and more severe,? CDC officials <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/ClimateChangeandExtremeHeatEvents.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a>. ?By the end of this century,
extremely high temperatures that currently occur once every 20 years could
happen as often as every two to four years.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-20T18:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-20T18:00:00</updateddate><category>Outdoor Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/heatwave-hazards-include-third-degree-burns-docs-warn</guid><dc:date>2017-06-20T18:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Many Rape Victims ?Paralyzed? by Fear During Assault, Study Finds</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/many-rape-victims-paralyzed-by-fear-during-assault-study-finds </link><description><![CDATA[<p>You?ve
likely heard of the fight-or-flight response ? but what about freeze?</p>

<p>A
new study published in the journal <a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/wf/click?upn=gdq3ZfNBU6F1Pkd0PW7MeeSCD-2FZiiRnO-2B88T3gqIV5nPhXCaLAtlcu2bdFl6e1nYP5h0G7pUcmC5xxyR7S6iY6VgjBAvZahNhqO9jsPOMIKKohqOytWh67RruAWpjTnQCgVTDgK4cPwnL7LoSTXxhh-2FH1Wr6ZkXvvXT8kJTNT9R7FyC7BLxtua2xKLvAUijnLYiJQ3u3hsbnVAzrvHkxfAYsblNwsXzEGx0sQ3AOld1MeOteFt51k9pkAP-2B-2F6IE-2F_jmdEulM-2FBkLa1m8oDDE6xSIk0955NfMs5tbV116oqivSKXsMblpmrAZXDEohf85fETFyujD6oWNrwfUGsZhNZkUMprLLOi-2BZGfqdw5HPX41-2BAPQnW1Bl5YA4pDsHz4lh9jk0DnWqymlzV-2Ff6YIs0OzDg99JkpOK22ACJ-2BNr0a9ANbvmKKBRmEu6K-2B89dfeoDBy4eU5uyx8zaVE6N4pW9OtVB5co1nmW5aY9YwWbV4ZrsLB3SVvlM64E-2FOEFb6FWlGTXo-2FiGHZvw0Clrs8BWX6iyKNgT-2BMnbp-2F4xaFee27IxpxKRqEmGpYzEH1vCJmeEb" target="_blank">Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica</a> suggests that many people who are raped
experience involuntary paralysis during the assault.</p>

<p>This
type of paralysis is also known as tonic immobility. </p>

<p>It?s
a temporary motor inhibition that can make it impossible for someone to call
out, flee, or fight back during a traumatic encounter.</p>

<p>?It?s
actually a biological response,? lead author, Dr. Anna Moller, of the Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm South General Hospital in
Sweden, told Healthline.
?When a person or animal is exposed to a threat, the parasympathetic nervous
system gets activated, meaning that you get a low pulse, you get low blood
pressure, and you can get passive or paralyzed.? </p>





<h2>A precursor for depression
and PTSD?</h2>

<p>Moller
and colleagues used the Tonic Immobility Scale to assess 298 women who visited the Emergency Clinic for
Rape Victims in Stockholm within one month of being sexually assaulted.</p>

<p>After
six months, they assessed 189 of those women for features of post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.</p>

<p>They
found that 70 percent of the 298 participants reported experiencing symptoms of
significant tonic immobility while being sexually assaulted. Forty-eight
percent reported experiencing symptoms of extreme tonic immobility.</p>

<p>Among
the 189 participants who took part in the six-month follow-up assessment, approximately
38 percent had developed PTSD, and 22 percent had developed severe depression. </p>

<p>Participants
who reported experiencing tonic immobility were more than twice as likely to
develop PTSD, and more than three times as likely to develop depression.</p>

<p>Those
with a past history of sexual assault were at higher risk of experiencing tonic
immobility, as well as PTSD and depression.</p>





<h2>Survivors don?t fit ?ideal
victim? stereotype</h2>

<p>Tonic
immobility is thought to be an evolved defensive response to intense fear. </p>

<p>Most
research on the phenomenon has focused on nonhuman animals.</p>

<p>But
in recent decades, investigators have increasingly studied tonic immobility in
humans, particularly among people who survive sexual assault.</p>

<p>While
past studies have linked tonic immobility to PTSD, this is the first
investigation to prospectively examine that association.</p>

<p>More
research is needed to learn why survivors of sexual assault who experience
tonic immobility are more likely to develop PTSD.</p>

<p>The
responses they receive following the assault might play a part.</p>

<p>The
stereotype of an ?ideal victim? is someone who actively resists an assailant.</p>

<p>When
someone doesn?t fit that stereotype, it can influence how they perceive
themselves and how they are treated by others.</p>

<p>?Shame
and guilt are some of the most common reactions among our patients,? Moller
noted. ?This is a very common reaction: ?Why didn?t I say ?No,? or push him
off???</p>

<p>People
who don?t actively resist may also be taken less seriously or granted less
sympathy by other community members, including family, friends, law
enforcement, and those involved in trying legal cases.</p>

<p>In
turn, experiences of blame and skepticism can negatively impact survivors?
mental health. </p>

<p>?If
you run into this paralyzed state and don?t resist, and you blame yourself and
get blame from others, and maybe the legal system questions what really
happened ? that?s also important in the development of PTSD,? Moller suggested.
</p>

<p>?It?s
not just what you?ve experienced before and during the trauma itself, it?s also
what happens afterwards. Did you get a lot of social support? Or are you being
questioned? That?s going to affect your risk of developing PTSD.?</p>





<h2>Greater awareness needed</h2>

<p>To promote better support for people who
survive sexual assault, Moller
emphasized the importance of raising awareness of tonic immobility.</p>

<p>?I think counsellors and health personnel who
work with rape victims should know about this and talk about this with their
patients, saying, ?It?s not strange that you didn?t resist because it?s the
most common way of reacting. It?s nothing wrong with you. You did what you
could.??</p>

<p>She
also advocated for changes in how sexual assault is managed in legal systems.</p>

<p>For
one thing, she argued that silence and passiveness should not be considered
consent.</p>

<p>For
another thing, she suggested that less emphasis should be placed on
complainants? injuries.</p>

<p>?In
court proceedings, there?s still a lot of attention given to injuries ? did the
rape cause any injuries? But if the victim doesn?t resist, the perpetrator
doesn?t have to use a lot of physical violence in order to continue with the
rape, and there won?t be many injuries.?</p>

<p>As a
next step in the research process, Moller plans to investigate the occurrence
of tonic immobility among men who have survived sexual assault.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-20T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-20T16:00:00</updateddate><category>Mental Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/many-rape-victims-paralyzed-by-fear-during-assault-study-finds</guid><dc:date>2017-06-20T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Can Yoga Reprogram Your DNA?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-yoga-reprogram-dna </link><description><![CDATA[<p>While
many attest to the positive effects yoga and meditation have on their overall
well-being, is there any hard science to back up these claims?</p>

<p>According
to a new study published in Frontiers
in Immunology, the answer could be ?Yes.? </p>

<p>Researchers
examined 18 studies published over the past 11 years. These studies included
information on 800 people. </p>

<p>The
researchers concluded that mind-body interventions (MBIs) ? activities such as
yoga, meditation, and tai chi ? actually affect the bodies? genes. The positive
benefits of these activities included a reduction of stress and related
symptoms at the molecular level.</p>

<p>?These activities are leaving what we call a
molecular signature in our cells, which reverses the effect that stress or
anxiety would have on the body by changing how our genes are expressed,? lead author
Ivana Buric, a PhD student at Coventry University, said in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/cu-may061417.php" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Put simply, MBIs cause the brain to steer our
DNA processes along a path that improves our well-being.</p>

<p>Specifically, MBIs are able to influence gene
activity related to inflammation. </p>

<p>During an interview with Healthline, Buric
said, ?When we do yoga or meditation, we learn to perceive
situations differently and consequently experience less stress, which then
prevents the production of inflammatory proteins,? he explained. </p>

<p>Rather than simply making one feel calm, or
relaxed, there are real changes occurring within the brain and nervous system.</p>

<h2>The mind-body connection </h2>

<p>Broadly, when we experience something stressful in our lives,
the sympathetic nervous system is engaged, increasing production of chemicals
in the body that are commonly associated with feelings of fear, danger, or
anxiety ? commonly called the ?fight-or-flight response.?</p>

<p>Of those chemicals, a molecule called nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-kB) is produced. It's responsible for causing genes to form proteins
known as cytokines, which are responsible for cell inflammation.</p>

<p>In people who practice MBIs, the opposite seems to happen. A decrease in both NF-kB and cytokines leads to lower levels of inflammation
in the body.</p>

<p>?The genes that we inherited can change their activity ... We
are now beginning to understand what aspects of our environment affect the
activity of which genes,? said Buric.</p>



<h2>Putting the findings into
practice</h2>

<p>The impact of MBIs on inflammation has potentially far-reaching
applications.</p>

<p>A range of psychological disorders, including PTSD,
depression, and anxiety, as well as other medical conditions like asthma and
arthritis, are all inflammation-related diseases.</p>

<p>However, Buric cautioned that there is no conclusive evidence
that MBIs can treat these illnesses and that research is still lacking. ?More needs to be
done to understand these effects in greater depth, for example, how they
compare with other healthy interventions like exercise or nutrition.?</p>

<p>While there has been
a <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/yoga-for-anxiety-and-depression" target="_blank">general sense</a> of how MBIs affect human brains, this new study gives a
deeper understanding of their impact on a molecular level. And highlighting a ?hard
science? approach might be more appealing to some skeptics.</p>

<p>MBIs occupy an increasingly important part of the health
practices for people in the United States. A study in the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882072/" target="_blank">Neurology</a> in 2008
indicated that half of adults in the country ?use complementary and alternative
medicine with mind-body therapy being the most commonly used form.?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nationwide-survey-reveals-widespread-use-mind-body-practices" target="_blank">National
Institutes of Health (NIH)</a> also published its own survey of American usage
of MBIs between 2002 and 2012, utilizing data from nearly 90,000 people. One of
their key findings was yoga practice for individuals aged 18-44 nearly doubled,
growing from approximately 5-10 percent.</p>

<p>At the same time, the American Psychological Association
reported a continuing <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2015/snapshot.aspx" target="_blank">rise in stress
level</a> by generation ? with
millennials and Gen Xers indicating significantly higher levels of stress than
their parents.</p>

<p>What is clear from all this data is that, without proper
treatment, stress levels ? particularly for younger and marginalized Americans ?
will continue to rise, possibly leading to deteriorating health. </p>

<p>As these groups seek out new treatments, pressure will mount on
the medical community to research the potential benefits of these nontraditional
treatments, including MBIs.</p>

<p>?This is an important foundation to build on to help future
researchers explore the benefits of increasingly popular mind-body activities.?

year there are <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2013-en/04/02/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fchapter%2Fhealth_glance-2013-33-en&amp;mimeType=text%2Fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2Fcontent%2Fserial%2F19991312&amp;accessItemIds=%2Fcontent%2Fbook%2Fhea" target="_blank">85 million CT scans</a> taken in the United States. Now
researchers in Australia say that data from these body scans could be used to
predict a person?s risk of death in the next five years ? and perhaps prompt them
to make changes that could extend their life.</p>

<p>Researchers
have previously used genetic and environmental data ? from diet to exercise
habits ? to estimate the life span of individuals, but a study from the
University of Adelaide was the first to use artificial intelligence (AI) to
analyze patient CT scans to predict mortality. </p>

<p>?Such
knowledge is critical for improved early intervention, for better treatment
decisions, and for ameliorating the steadily worsening epidemic of chronic
disease,? according to the study published in the journal <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01931-w" target="_blank">Scientific Reports</a>.</p>

<p>The
researchers used a machine learning program to analyze 48 chest scans from
adults over 60 years of age. And a computer accurately predicted the chance of
death within five years 69 percent of the time. The team used old CT scans,
along with data on whether the patient died within five years, or lived longer,
which they used to verify the computer?s prediction. </p>

<p>The
69 percent accuracy rate is comparable to genetic and environmental-based
forecasting of future life span, according to researcher Dr. Luke
Oakden-Rayner, a radiologist at Royal Adelaide Hospital and a PhD student. </p>

<p>The
results show that AI analysis of CT scans could be a powerful and efficient new
tool for doctors when analyzing patients? health and risk of death ? or
catching harmful conditions in an earlier stage.</p>

<p>This
information could be used to guide healthcare choices, including preventative
measures, such as lifestyle changes. Similar information is already provided to
patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, and many people do find it
motivating. </p>

<p>?We
hope that systems like ours will be able to provide this information earlier,
when there is more opportunity to prevent serious complications,? said study
co-author, Lyle J. Palmer, PhD, professor of epidemiology at the University of
Adelaide.</p>



<h2>The hope
of training computers to predict life span</h2>

<p>The
small size of the study left researchers unable to determine the basis of the
computer?s predictions, but a follow-up will apply the same model to tens of
thousands of CT images.</p>

<p>?Extensive
data is crucial for training deep-learning systems to make accurate predictions,?
said Robert Hudyma, MSc, associate professor at Ryerson University?s School of
Information Technology Management. </p>

<p>Hudyma,
who isn?t associated with the study, noted that a company called <a href="https://www.enlitic.com/" target="_blank">Enlitic</a> trained its AI system on more
than 17,000 chest X-rays to ?diagnose cancerous tumors with a greater accuracy
than a radiologist or oncologist can.?</p>

<p>?What
Enlitic is doing is improving tumor diagnosis, which has the potential to save
lives,? he said. ?Similar work is underway to take a picture of a skin lesion
with a smartphone and essentially diagnose various skin conditions using a
neural network instead of a dermatologist.?</p>



<h2>Weighing
prevention against privacy risk</h2>

<p>As
with genetic information, the use of AI to predict future health problems and
life span raises ethical concerns, including how such data could be misused by
employers and insurers. </p>

<p>However,
there are major potential benefits of using AI to catch diseases early, Palmer
said. ?Prevention is almost always cheaper than a cure, so insurers and
employers will have a financial interest in funding measures that keep
individuals healthy. </p>

<p>?While
there are legitimate concerns about misuse of private medical data, there are
no ethical issues specific to the data we are generating,? said Palmer. ?And we
think that the sort of approach we motivate will have benefits that far
outweigh any privacy-related risk.?</p>

<p>But don?t
expect routine annual CT scans anytime soon. A <a href="https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/breast-cancer/news/in-the-journals/%7B89a6a4c0-8b67-4774-8797-fbaa81f97d34%7D/biennial-mammograms-from-age-50-years-reduce-risk-for-radiation-induced-breast-cancer" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> found that exposure to radiation from
multiple unnecessary body scans significantly increases risk of cancer.
However, a single scan is generally considered safe.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-20T09:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-20T09:00:00</updateddate><category>Technology</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/ai-could-predict-how-long-you-live</guid><dc:date>2017-06-20T09:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Researchers Studying Vaccine to See if It Can Stop High Cholesterol</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/researchers-studying-vaccine-to-see-if-it-can-stop-high-cholesterol </link><description><![CDATA[<p>With heart
disease the number one <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm" target="_blank">cause
of death</a> for men and women in the United States, the
medical community has increasingly focused on how to lower cholesterol and
reduce cardiac events like heart attacks. </p>

<p>While drugs
like statins and other medications have helped mitigate some of these risks and
control cholesterol levels, researchers are now investigating if a vaccine
could be an even better option.</p>

<p>Researchers
based in Austria and the Netherlands published the results of a mouse-based
study today in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj" target="_blank">European Heart Journal</a>, which found evidence that a vaccine can
encourage the body to attack a certain enzyme called PCSK9. That enzyme is
associated with higher levels of LDL or ?bad? cholesterol. </p>

<p>In the study the
mice received the vaccine, called AT04A, which was designed to induce antibodies that target PCSK9. The mice
that received the vaccine were found to have lower cholesterol, fewer
inflammation markers, and less atherosclerotic damage in the blood vessels, than
the control group during the 18-week study period. </p>

<p>While the study only focused on mice,
researchers are now starting a phase I trial to see if the vaccine is safe and
effective in humans as well. </p>

<p>Gunther
Staffler, PhD, CTO at AFFiRiS ? the company that developed AT04A ? and one of
the authors of the study, said in a statement released today, that the levels
of cholesterol were reduced in mice in a ?consistent and long-lasting way.?</p>

<p>?The
reduction in total cholesterol levels was significantly correlated with induced
antibody concentration, proving that induced antibodies caused the reduction in
cholesterol and also are ultimately responsible for the reduction of
atherosclerosis development,? Staffler said in the statement. </p>

<p>Additionally,
the researchers found evidence that the antibodies didn?t disappear quickly
after the vaccine was given, with the levels of PCSK9 depressed for at least 18 weeks after vaccination. </p>

<p>?As antibody
concentrations remained high at the end of the study, it can be assumed they
would continue to reduce cholesterol levels for some time afterward, resulting
in a long-lasting effect, as has been shown in previous studies,? Staffler
continued. </p>




<h2>Future trials</h2>

<p>In an
accompanying editorial, researchers from Germany and the United Kingdom said
that as a result of the study results they would ?promise to evaluate further?
the long-term effects of lowering LDL cholesterol via vaccination. </p>

<p>They pointed
out that a vaccine that could help prevent a build-up of LDL, and as a result
possibly stop damage to the blood vessels via plaque build-up that can lead to
heart attack or stroke. </p>

<p>However, they stress that the vaccine is
unproven in humans. </p>

<p>?Safety, the response in humans, and the very
important but unknown long-term immune effects, need to be very carefully
addressed during the course of clinical development,? they noted. </p>

<p>Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease
expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that this study was
?pushing the envelope? by taking the infectious disease vaccine model and
applying it to treat cardiovascular disease. </p>

<p>?They have created a vaccine that in mice does indeed lower cholesterol and
it results in reduced inflammation and reduced plaque formation, and it would
appear to be, at least in this limited model, as something that's worth trying
out in humans,? Schaffner said. </p>

<p>Despite the interesting findings, Schaffner said there is no
guarantee the findings will be replicated once humans receive the vaccine. </p>

<p>?All these concepts are exciting and proactive but we have to recognize when we move in the vaccine world ? many vaccines are tried but very few result in products that work, I
think the ratio is about 10 to 1,? he explained.</p>

<p>Oliver Siegel, the
CEO of AFFiRis, said that they expect the initial phase I
trial to be completed by the end of the year with the findings published as
early as January next year. He also said that the vaccine may provide a better
and cheaper option for people currently who have either not responded to
statins or didn?t like taking them. </p>

<p>?What we see is that people don?t like taking a pill on a
daily basis,? Siegel said. Should the vaccine prove to be safe and effective in
humans, Siegel said they hope that people may not have to get more than one
vaccination a year to keep their LDL cholesterol levels low.</p>

<p>However, Siegel stressed they must first
determine that the vaccine works for humans in addition to mice. </p>

<p>?The key thing is this must be
safe,? he said. </p>

tiny, adorable, and quite possibly the answer to medical researchers? dreams.</p>

<p>The
big-eyed mouse lemur, the world?s smallest primate, may soon replace fruit
flies, worms, and even mice as the primary lab animal for scientific research. </p>

<p>For
decades, these three animals were the prototypical lab specimen because they
were inexpensive to maintain, easy to study, and reproduced quickly enough to
offer researchers a constant stream of samples.</p>

<p>But
their genetic makeup hasn?t been a close enough match to humans to work well
for the studies today?s researchers need to conduct, said Mark Krasnow, MD,
PhD, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University.</p>

<p>?Many
aspects of primate biology, behavior, health, and ecology cannot be modeled in
those simpler genetic model organisms,? Krasnow said.</p>

<p>That?s
why, in 2009, Krasnow challenged three of his lab?s high school interns to find
a replacement for the mice, rats, flies, and worms. Krasnow, whose primary
field of study is lung disease, needed this new creature to meet certain
criteria. The potential replacement had to be easy to manage, reproduce
rapidly, and yield many offspring.</p>

<p>A
few months later, the interns came back with an answer: Madagascar?s mouse
lemur.</p>



<h2>What makes the mouse lemur
special?</h2>

<p>A
mouse lemur, unlike its larger cousin the ring-tailed lemur, is quite small.
The average mouse lemur is about two times the size of a mouse, which, along
with their small-sized diets, makes maintaining and managing a lab of mouse
lemurs inexpensive. </p>

<p>Their
gestation is fast ? just 60 days. Another 60 days after birth, the tiny
primates can be independent of their mothers. Most pregnant lemurs produce two
offspring, and within a year, young mouse lemurs can begin to reproduce.</p>

<p>For
Krasnow, however, it?s the lemur?s natural home that makes studying them so
spectacular.</p>

<p>Mouse
lemurs are found on Madagascar. The island nation is home to 24 million people
and 20 million mouse lemurs.</p>

<p>?It
[a mouse lemur] reproduces quickly, and there are millions of mouse lemurs in
Madagascar, perfect for systematic genetic studies to identify the genes
underlying individual traits,? Krasnow said.</p>

<p>Also,
unlike the ring-tailed lemurs, mouse lemurs are not endangered. Many of the
natural habitats for ring-tailed lemurs are threatened as farming, mining, and
logging operations sweep the island. Despite the shifting landscape, mouse
lemurs are prolific and run freely across Madagascar.</p>

<p>Genetically,
they?re closer to humans than any of the other creatures researchers have used
previously. Lemurs are about midway between mice and humans, according to
Krasnow. </p>

<p>The
researchers hope that means primate-specific studies that would have failed in
mice may now succeed in lemurs. Their biology can mimic many aspects of human
biology, and Krasnow and his colleagues have found that the creature naturally has
many of the same diseases that humans develop.</p>

<p>Unlike
mice that often must be injected or bred with genetic mutations, lemurs already
have them, ?including genes that influence movement, obesity,
hypercholesterolemia, prediabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, and speciation,?
Krasnow explained. So far, the researchers working on the project have identified
20 genetic mutations in lemurs that match mutations humans have.</p>

<p>For
example, aging lemurs develop a form of dementia that other species don?t.
Studying the reasons for this cognitive disorder isn?t possible in many other
creatures.</p>

<p>Likewise,
mouse lemurs accumulate plaque on their brains ? just like humans with
Alzheimer?s disease. Until now, dementia researchers had few options for
studying this condition. </p>

<p>Advancements
in understanding and treating diseases in mouse lemurs can lead to similar developments
for humans.</p>



<h2>Madagascar, the great laboratory
</h2>

<p>Stanford
University is nearly 11,000 miles or 17,000 kilometers from Madagascar. That
makes studying lemurs from Krasnow?s California laboratories difficult.</p>

<p>When
they first started the mouse lemur research, Krasnow and his colleagues joined
forces with Centre ValBio, a research facility near the Ranomafana National
Park in Madagascar. Then, in 2013, Stanford built a genetic lab within the
complex for their faculty.</p>

<p>Krasnow
said leaving mouse lemurs in their natural habitat is ideal. That way,
researchers can understand more about the impact of the environment on these
animals? health and genes.</p>

<p>?One
can study the relationship between genes and the natural environment, and how
they interact to influence specific traits such as health and survival in
native settings,? Krasnow said. </p>

<p>But
sequencing genomes of lemurs is a big project, and it?s ongoing. The
researchers need more hands to trap, tag, test, and release the lemurs for
their study.</p>

<p>That?s
why Stanford, in coordination with several research facilities and schools in
Madagascar, helped launch a citizen science project. The mission is twofold.</p>

<p>First,
Stanford professors are helping high schools in Madagascar develop a science
curriculum in hopes of sparking in the students an interest in science. They?re
using inexpensive tools to let kids explore the diverse and rich environment
right outside their classrooms.</p>

<p>Then,
after the students complete high school, the researchers hope they?ll return as
university students to help screen mouse lemurs and contribute to the research.
For those who don?t make it to the lab, the researchers hope to encourage
appreciation of the vital work that?s being done with the island?s smallest
primate inhabitants.</p>

<p>?The
students are eager to learn, and love getting out of the classroom to explore
their environment, equipped with simple but powerful science tools like $1
paper microscopes created by our Stanford colleague Manu Prakash,? said
Krasnow. ?And we love helping in their discoveries, all new to them and many
new to us ? and even science too.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-19T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-19T16:00:00</updateddate><category>Technology</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/adorable-mouse-lemurs-may-change-the-face-of-medical-research</guid><dc:date>2017-06-19T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Health Experts Praise ?Wonder Woman? Movie</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/health-experts-praise-wonder-woman-movie </link><description><![CDATA[<p>She
marveled the comic book-reading masses in 1941.</p>

<p>She
dazzled television audiences in 1974.</p>

<p>Today,
76 years after her debut, Wonder Woman is still taking audiences by storm ? or
rather, by the Lasso of Truth.</p>

<p>The
evolution of Wonder Woman from 1941?s gentile superhero to today?s armor-clad
warrior is as much a timeline of feminism in popular culture as a Sears
catalogue.</p>



<h2>Wonder woman as
role model</h2>

<p>When
she was introduced, Wonder Woman wore a red bustier, blue shorts, knee-high red
leather boots, and a golden tiara. Her clothing choices were much more risque
than her male superhero counterparts, who wore full-body crime fighting suits.</p>

<p>The
look, said Wonder Woman?s creator William Moulton Marston, a renowned
psychologist in his time, was about declaring that women should be treated
equally in the fight for everything from women?s rights to ending fascism.</p>

<p>In
1943, Marston <a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/17/a-psychologist-and-a-superhero/" target="_blank">wrote</a>, ?Not even girls want to be
girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power ? The
obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of
Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.?</p>

<p>Sometimes,
Wonder Woman?s attributes were leading indicators of changing times, and
sometimes they were lagging. In 1972, Gloria Steinem reclaimed the Wonder Woman
mantel and put the heroine on the cover of the first issue of Ms., an American
feminist magazine.</p>

<p>Lynda
Carter?s rendition for 1970s made-for-TV movies and a TV series carried a
little more crime-fighting weight than previous iterations.</p>

<p>For
everything Carter?s character lacked in fierceness, however, Gal Gadot?s 2017
Wonder Woman is every bit a warrior ? and even better, a strong role model.</p>

<p>Gadot?s
presence is strong ? her attire is armor, not a costume. Her wit is as fast as
her lasso. She doesn?t mince words when telling pilot Steve Trevor she won?t be
seduced by him if they rest next to each other in their journey from Themyscira
to London. Even her emotions give her strength; she doesn?t crumble under the
weight of them.</p>

<p>?Typically,
?bad-ass? women in film are portrayed as heartless, man-eating characters that are
tragically broken at the core,? said Kaity Rodriguez, psychotherapist,
confidence educator, and former Miss New Jersey USA. ?Wonder Woman shows that a
female can be strong and tough, while still caring and being feminine. This
sends a message that it?s possible to be strong and vulnerable at the same
time, a much healthier way of being,? Rodriguez said.</p>

<p>Rodriguez?s
personal experiences in the public eye have led her to work with women and
girls struggling with self-esteem and self-acceptance. Rodriguez said whether
we realize it or not, girls, young women, and older women alike all absorb
subliminal messages about their bodies or behaviors from the various forms of
media ? movies, television, magazines, and music ? they view.</p>

<p>?So
often, we are given the message that crying, loving, or even simply caring
makes us weak,? Rodriguez said. ?Girls need to know that it takes more strength
or courage to have and show emotions because doing so makes a person vulnerable
to being hurt.?</p>

<p>Women
can find that balance on full display in Gadot?s character, which has been
praised by body-positive pioneers and self-esteem coaches for the balance of
strength and sensitivity that makes the character relatable but also resilient.</p>

<p>?Yes,
Gal Gadot still fits the profile of a supermodel. However, her display of
strength, confidence, heroism, and independence brings a new image that women
and girls can strive to emulate, this time aiming for a goal that is well
within reach,? Rodriguez said.</p>

<p>?Today?s
super hero can be physically powerful while also dealing with real emotions
rather than hiding or suppressing them. We are remarkable beings, and I am so
happy to finally see characters that so appropriately show who we really are,
what we really are, how we should be portrayed,? said Alexandra Allred, former
U.S. Olympic Bobsled and U.S. Nationals Champion. Allred was over four months
pregnant when she won the U.S. Nationals for bobsled and was named Athlete of
the Year by the United States Olympic Committee. She was three months pregnant
with her third child when she earned her second black belt.</p>

<p>?Today?s
female super heroes are stronger because of the dual strength and
vulnerability. We don?t have to compartmentalize so that in a moment of crisis ?
personal drama, trauma ? we completely fold,? Allred said. ?This is what makes
women so strong. This is why we can handle all that we do. So, to see Wonder
Woman ?expose? her humanity made her all the more powerful and real. This is,
by the way, real life.?</p>



<h2>Gal Gadot?s real
Wonder Woman experience</h2>

<p>If
Gadot, an Israeli actress and former combat trainer in the Israel Defense Forces,
had to find a source of superhuman strength to play sword-wielding,
bullet-dodging Diana Prince, she didn?t have to look far. She was pulling her
Wonder Woman stunts, in some cases, while pregnant.</p>

<p>?I
was pregnant and showing for some of the additional scenes we shot,? Goldot
told Britain?s <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/gal-gadot-says-born-play-10573332" target="_blank">Mirror</a>. ?But they did some clever stuff
with special effects to hide my bump. It didn?t hinder the process, I could
still do the action stuff and the physical scenes. And now, it?s nice to look
at the movie and know that Maya is in the movie with me in some way. I love
that.? </p>

<p>Like
Gadot, Allred pulled her own stunts of sorts while pregnant and training for
the Olympics. ?I was training to make the U.S. women?s team, but I was
pregnant,? she said. ?I was squatting 350 pounds, running 20 miles per hour on
forced elevated treadmill runs, and doing extreme plyometrics. I was pushing a
425-pound sled, and I won U.S. Nationals.?</p>

<p>Sarah
Yamaguchi, MD, is an OB-GYN at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She has
treated patients who, like Gadot, needed to film for long hours and be
physically active during their pregnancies. ?As more women have entered the
workforce, we have had to reevaluate what really is safe in pregnancy. In the
distant past, before antibiotics and hygiene were common, women stayed at home
and also avoided exposure to germs, which could get them very sick,? Yamaguchi said.
?It is now very common for women to continue working throughout their pregnancy
both because that is what they want and also because they financially cannot
afford to take time off.?</p>

<p>In
more than one way, Gal Gadot, and the character of Diana Prince she so
powerfully portrayed in this year?s blockbuster film, can serve as both
inspiration and guiding light for women and girls of all ages. </p>

<p>Wonder
Woman and Gadot both show that women have no limits, and that setting your mind
to anything will help you achieve it, whether you?re fighting Nazis with
indestructible bracelets or filming superhero action shots for the silver
screen while several months pregnant.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-19T15:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-19T15:00:00</updateddate><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/health-experts-praise-wonder-woman-movie</guid><dc:date>2017-06-19T15:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Are Stem Cells the Answer to Bringing People Back from the Dead?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-stem-cells-the-answer-to-bringing-people-back-from-the-dead </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Philadelphia-based
biotech company Bioquark is preparing to run trials in Latin America of a
controversial new treatment to restore brain function in people with brain damage.</p>

<p>The
procedure consists of several different parts. One of which uses a patient?s
own stem cells to regrow dead brain tissue. The procedure also includes a
peptide injection into the spine, laser therapy on the brain, and nerve
stimulation.</p>

<p>?The
first thing we are really looking at is how do we make that new tissue, along the
lines of how it is done in nature,? Ira Pastor, CEO of Bioquark, told
Healthline.</p>

<p>Doctors
and staff measure the brain activity and physical signs of the patient to
establish whether or not there has been an improvement.</p>

<p>While
the research has often been labeled as an attempt to<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
</span>?<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/experiment-raise-dead-blocked-india" target="_blank">raise the dead</a>,?
Pastor said
that there are actually significant limitations to the scope of what they are
trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>?We
are only focusing on what we refer to as the gray zone that exists between [a]
deep coma and so-called irreversible coma, which is the definition of brain
death, and transitioning the subject back through that area,? said Pastor.</p>

<h2>Understanding brain death </h2>

<p>Measure
of an individual?s state of coma or unconsciousness typically utilizes the <a href="http://www.glasgowcomascale.org" target="_blank">Glasgow Coma Scale</a>, an indicator of the severity
based on verbal and physiological responses.</p>

<p>Bioquark?s
aim is essentially to be able to take individuals from a state of irreversible
coma to, potentially, one in which they are showing higher brain functioning
and physiological response.</p>

<p>He said
that the treatment is not intended for individuals with catastrophic injuries,
or those with chronic diseases, such as metastatic cancer.</p>

<p>Brain
death is a relatively new concept in medicine and law, and still varies largely
from one country to the next. Unlike clinical death, as defined by the stopping
of certain biological functions ? such as breathing and heart rate ? brain
death is a state in which an individual may still be physically alive but with
little or no cognitive ability.</p>

<p>The
concept of brain death is attributed to a 1968 <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/340177" target="_blank">paper from Harvard
University</a>
that sought to ?define irreversible coma as a new criterion for death.? Since
then, legislation such as the <a href="http://www.lchc.ucsd.edu/cogn_150/Readings/death_act.pdf" target="_blank">Uniform
Determination of Death Act</a>, has sought to create a unified framework for how death is
diagnosed, including brain death.</p>

<p>The
implications of Bioquark?s research potentially altering or muddying an already
complex definition of death are profound. ?This study deepens the ambiguity
of the validity of the definition of death,? Kerry Bowman, PhD, a bioethicist
at the University of Toronto, told Healthline.</p>





<h2>Highly controversial
research </h2>

<p>The
procedure has also proved wildly controversial for ethical and medical reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly,
the research falls under the classification of ?living cadaver research,? which
Pastor describes as, ?The ability to use a recently deceased individual who is
still on life support for medical research purposes.?</p>

<p>Pastor
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5303606/" target="_blank">argued</a>
previously
that living cadaver research has been carried out ethically for a variety of
reasons in the Unites States. Nonetheless, it remains a sensitive subject.</p>

<p>There
are those in the medical community who criticize Bioquark because there simply
isn?t any <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5118884/" target="_blank">medical research</a>
to support its work.
One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20530327" target="_blank">meta study</a> published in the journal
Neurology in 2010, concluded that from 1995 onward, ?There are no published reports
of recovery of neurologic function after a diagnosis of brain death.?</p>

<p>Pastor
contests this, citing <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818943" target="_blank">sporadic cases</a> challenging that conclusion.</p>



<h2>Grief and consent</h2>

<p>Bowman
said the two major concerns surrounding Bioquark?s work are family grief and
patient consent.</p>

<p>In
the first case, he said, the procedure ?could create a situation where [the
family] believes that their brain-dead or close to brain-dead loved one has a
chance for survival, and that the medical establishments are blocking them from
pursuing that chance.? </p>

<p>?I
think that really could be very difficult in terms of complicating grief.?</p>

<p>The
second issue, consent, is even more contentious. Who signs off on the procedure
if the patient doesn?t have the capacity to say ?Yes? or ?No??</p>

<p>?Clearly
this is a case where the subject cannot consent,? said Pastor. ?The informed
consent documents that we have put together are really family centric.?</p>

<p>?There
is a line of reasons why a family might want to come down this path, but
ultimately it?s their decision.?</p>

<p>Others
disagree that consent in this situation is as clear as Pastor makes it.</p>

<p>Bowman
said that the potential risk of such a procedure is so high that the consent
must come directly from the patient.</p>

<p>?The
ranges of outcomes ? I see physical impairment and neurological impairment as
almost a certainty even if there is success ? that I just don?t think you could
have a substituted consent.?</p>

<p>Some
have suggested that <a href="http://scroll.in/pulse/808634/why-an-indo-us-project-to-bring-the-dead-back-to-life-is-no-laughing-matter" target="_blank">consent</a> could be coerced under the proposition of bringing
back a loved one.</p>

<p>Pastor,
however, is confident in Bioquark?s proceedings.</p>

<p>?Of
the multitude of different types of bioethical arguments or questions we get, I
think we?re comfortable with that family-centric, informed consent approach,?
he said.</p>

<p>Whether
or not Bioquark ultimately succeeds, their upcoming trials will undoubtedly
have a profound impact on the concept of death.</p>

<p>Bowman,
while skeptical of Bioquark?s research from a medical perspective, is open to
challenging the established notion of brain death.</p>

<p>?There
are places in the world that are much more hesitant about accepting brain death
as truly death,? he said. ?We constructed this as a definition of death, but we
can also deconstruct a definition that we created ourselves.?</p>

<p>As
to the claim that Pastor and Bioquark are offering ?false hope? to those that
are already vulnerable and suffering, he remains defiant.</p>

<p>?Exploratory
research programs of this nature are not false hope. They are a glimmer of
hope.?</p>

Disease Cluster Spotlights Increasing Number of Cases</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/nyc-legionnaires-disease-cluster </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Legionnaires?
disease has made headlines again after seven people living in Manhattan were
diagnosed with the disease over just 11 days, according to officials at the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/pr051-17.page" target="_blank">New
York City Health Department</a>.</p>

<p>One of the
patients ? who had underlying health conditions and was in their 90s ? died
after contracting the disease. </p>

<p>Reported
cases of the disease have skyrocketed since 2000, and just this year the
disease made headlines after it infected a New York City police officer, four
Florida gym goers, and two newborns in Arizona. </p>

<p>First
discovered in 1976, <a href="/health/legionnaires-disease#overview1">Legionnaires? disease</a>, or
Legionellosis, was
catapulted into headlines after it infected <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214295/" target="_blank">221 people</a> attending a conference of
American Legionnaires at a Philadelphia hotel. Of those infected, 34 people
died. </p>

<p>Thousands
are infected every year and out of those who become sickened by the bacteria,
an estimated one 1 in 10 will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). </p>



<h2>What causes
Legionnaires? disease? </h2>

<p>In the
decades after the 1976 outbreak researchers have learned much more about the
naturally-occurring, potentially life-threatening <em>Legionella</em> bacteria that causes Legionnaires? disease. The microorganisms
are dangerous when they multiply in a water supply and become aerosolized into
a breathable mist. </p>

<p>Cases are
more commonly reported during the summer and early fall, when temperatures
increase habitats that are more favorable to the bacteria. It?s also the time
that more air conditioners are turned on, and people are visiting bodies of
water where the bacteria may live naturally.</p>

<p>The disease
is caused when the bacteria
infect a person via inhaled droplets. The disease usually results in <a href="/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>-like symptoms, but can also include aches, pains,
and diarrhea. It cannot spread from person to person.</p>

<p>In the 1976
outbreak it was the air conditioning system that aerosolized the water leading
to the mass number of infections. But decorative fountains, cooling towers, and
even grocery produce misters have also been linked to the bacterial infection
in the past. </p>

<p>Dr.
Frank Esper, assistant professor, and pediatric infectious disease specialist
at Case Western University School of Medicine and Rainbow Babies and Children's
Hospital in Cleveland, said that treating the water to kill the bacteria can
also be tricky. </p>

<p>?The problem with <em>Legionella</em> is that it?s resistant to chlorine and so while they do
try, you can't chlorine the problem away,? Esper explained to Healthline.</p>



<h2>?Puzzling? increase</h2>

<p>Despite
decades of research, scientists remain unsure why the infections have been
rising in the Unites States. </p>

<p>From 2000 to
2015 the number of estimated cases increased four-and-a-half times with
approximately 6,000 cases of the disease reported in 2015, according to the
CDC. </p>

<p>The reason
for this drastic increase is not fully understood. One likely factor is that testing
for the disease has become more commonplace, according to Dr. William Schaffner,
an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. </p>

<p>?Legionnaires? may account for 1 to 10 percent
of all pneumonia cases,? Schaffner told Healthline. Among the possible ?reasons
that there may be an increase in reported Legionnaires? is that doctors are
using a widely available urine test ... you get the urine, and you detect
remnants of the bacteria in the urine. It's much easier than getting a specimen
of sputum.?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/surv-reporting.html" target="_blank">CDC
reports</a> that the rise in cases could be related to a
number of factors including a more vulnerable population, aging infrastructure,
and a warming climate. Less invasive testing via urine instead of cultured
bacteria could also be a reason that more cases are being reported. </p>

<p>However,
none of these factors have yet definitively been linked to the increasing
number of Legionnaires? disease cases. </p>

<p>Locating a source of a disease outbreak can be difficult since the
incubation period is between two to 10 days after exposure, and many healthy
people will not exhibit any symptoms after exposure. </p>

<p>In addition
to air conditioning units, Legionnaires? disease outbreaks can occur from
fountains or even the produce misters at grocery stories. In Arizona, two
newborns were diagnosed with the disease after being born <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6622a4.htm" target="_blank">via water births</a> in tubs. </p>

<p>Healthcare
centers were found to be particularly adept at causing outbreaks, according to
a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6622e1.htm?s_cid=mm6622e1_w" target="_blank">report</a> from the CDC published this
June. After reviewing 27
Legionnaires? disease outbreaks investigated by the CDC, the study authors
found that these centers accounted for 57 percent of outbreak-associated
infections, and 85 percent of outbreak-associated deaths.</p>

<p>While outbreaks can be challenging, Schaffner said tracking the origin
of Legionnaires? diseases not associated with an outbreak can be even more difficult.
</p>

<p>?About 75 percent of cases are what we call sporadic, they occur here or
there,? he said. ?About 25 percent occur in clusters or outbreaks.?</p>

<p>Without additional cases found in an outbreak, narrowing down a single
source of infection can be difficult or nearly impossible.</p>

<p>?We are all
very puzzled by sporadic cases,? said Schaffner. </p>

<h2>Stopping Outbreaks</h2>

<p>To stop
clusters of Legionnaires? disease from spreading, health officials have focused
on improving water management to stop bacteria from growing in the first place.
</p>

<p>In the June
CDC report, the researchers found that that 85 percent of outbreaks could have
been stopped with more effective water management. This means keeping water
temperature either above or below the warm temps favored by <em>Legionella</em>, keeping the water moving so
it doesn?t stagnate, and adequately disinfecting the water. </p>

<p>Additionally,
stopping corrosion and ?biofilm? build-up in the water management system is key
to keeping the <em>Legionella</em> from
flourishing. </p>



<h2>Getting the right
diagnosis</h2>

<p>Correctly
identifying Legionnaires? disease early is key to saving lives. While the test
is relatively simple to run, many doctors may not think to test for this
atypical cause of pneumonia, according to Schaffner. </p>

<p>?The trick
is to think about it, because the conventional treatment for pneumonia doesn't work
against <em>Legionella</em>,? Schaffner
explained. </p>

<p>Those most
at risk for infection are people with underlying health issues, people over 50
years of age, and those with compromised immune systems. Current or past
smokers are also at higher risk. </p>

<p>In the CDC report the study authors emphasized that getting a quick diagnosis is also
key to stopping an outbreak of Legionnaires? disease from worsening.</p>

<p>?Legionnaires? disease is clinically
indistinguishable from other causes of pneumonia; a failure to diagnose a
healthcare-associated case could result in a missed opportunity to prevent
subsequent cases,? the authors wrote. </p>

<p>Esper said Legionnaires? often presents as an ?atypical?
pneumonia. Since pneumonia can be especially deadly in older people, Esper said
there is no time to waste in getting the them the right treatment. </p>

<p>?You don't give
yourself a lot of leeway, you want to hit it, and hit it hard,? Esper said.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-19T12:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-19T12:00:00</updateddate><category>General Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/nyc-legionnaires-disease-cluster</guid><dc:date>2017-06-19T12:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Multiple Sclerosis May Affect Ability to Read Social Cues</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/multiple-sclerosis-may-affect-ability-to-read-social-cues </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Multiple
sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease that can damage key parts of the
central nervous system and may cause a host of debilitating symptoms. Many
people associate MS with the gradual loss of motor function and sensation, but this
does not complete the picture of this complex condition.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2017/05/31/WNL.0000000000004069.extract" target="_blank">recent
study</a> asserts that MS can actually alter the way people
with the disease perceive and process social situations. And it may even shed
some light on why some people with MS may easily misread a situation and react differently
than expected.</p>

<p>MS disease
activity can trigger changes in the brain?s white matter, which controls many
higher brain functions. These changes can lead to deficiencies in both theory
of mind (ToM) and facial emotion recognition, which are significant when compared
with people who don?t have MS.</p>

<p>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states
such as intentions and beliefs to oneself and others, and to understand that
these states may be different than one?s own. For example, someone might be
talking, explaining a situation with no malicious intent, but a person with MS
could misinterpret the facial expressions of the person speaking and perceive
them as angry. </p>

<p>This is not
the first study to look into ToM and MS. Social cognition and MS have been
studied for years, and the research points to significant differences between people
with MS and control groups. A
recent analysis of the connection between MS and ToM covered <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085073/" target="_blank">21 studies</a> that provided data on over 1,200 people with MS.
The researchers? analyses showed similar levels of cognitive decline than what
were noted in the new study.</p>

<p>Social <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085073/" target="_blank">cognitive deficits</a> are often overlooked, but offer significant
opportunities to improve social functioning and quality of life. Human <a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/06/06/ms-patient-importance-cultivating-your-circle/" target="_blank">connectivity
is critical</a> for those living with MS, but cognitive
issues can interfere. </p>

<p>According to the National MS Society, cognitive
dysfunction could be present in over <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Documents/Transcript-Prevalence-of-Cognitive-Symptoms.pdf" target="_blank">60 percent</a> of people with MS, and has been
reported at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. </p>

<p>While the deficits in ToM and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085073/" target="_blank">facial emotion recognition</a> among those with MS were not as severe as those identified
in people with schizophrenia or in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Parkinson?s disease, the differences were significant. </p>

<p>The results of these studies emphasize the need
to increase awareness of social cognitive dysfunction. They also support the monitoring
of social cognition to be incorporated into routine neurologic assessments. </p>



<h2>Rewiring the brain</h2>

<p>ToM <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28406663" target="_blank">cognitive
difficulties</a> happen in all levels of multiple
sclerosis, especially in the speed which information is processed. Clinical
studies are looking at how to remedy ToM deficiency through meditation and, of
all things, video games. </p>

<p>One study
out of Germany found significant indications of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712309/" target="_blank">positive
relationship</a> between mindful meditation and improving
age-related brain atrophy, suggesting the need for further studies. The Journal
of Cognitive Enhancement recently published an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0022-7" target="_blank">article</a> covering a variety of studies showing successful results from practicing
mindful meditation and brain training in improving cognitive function. </p>

<p>Another
newly published <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177177" target="_blank">study</a> from researchers at the New York University Langone Medical
Center, showed that brain training had significantly <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177177" target="_blank">greater
impact</a> on improving cognition in people with MS
than the computer games (<a href="https://www.brainhq.com/" target="_blank">BrainHQ</a> by Posit Science) used by a comparison group. The brain training
was funded by the NMSS. </p>

<p>Henry
Mahncke, CEO of Posit Science, explained to Healthline that ?brain training
works by targeting different parts of the brain but with one goal: faster and more
accurate brain processing, leading to better memory and problem solving.? </p>

<p>Mahncke explained
the importance of modern thinking and understanding that ?a brain is plastic
and has the ability to rewire itself, that the brain is not like a computer
chip that wears out.? </p>

at Brigham and Women?s Hospital in Boston say that when it comes to prescribing
pain relief following a cesarean delivery,
shared decision-making is crucial.</p>

<p>In a survey,
the researchers found that opioids may be overprescribed to women who have had cesarean deliveries. And in a
second, related study, it was found that patients would prefer to be prescribed
less medication.</p>

<p>?It?s of
interest because cesarean delivery is
the most common inpatient surgical procedure in the United States, and almost
all patients in the U.S. receive a prescription for an opioid medication after cesarean delivery,? Dr. Brian
Bateman, chief of Obstetric Anesthesia at Brigham and Women?s Hospital, and
corresponding author of the two papers, told Healthline.</p>

<p>In the first
study, 720 women from six academic medical centers in the United States were
surveyed on what they were prescribed following a cesarean delivery.
Ninety-five percent of the women surveyed reported they had not thrown out
their excess medication two weeks after being discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p>The second
study dealt with a shared decision-making tool. The tablet-based tool allowed
study participants to make an informed decision, along with a clinician, on how
many pills they?d like to be prescribed. It was found that the shared
decision-making tool caused the number of opioid pills prescribed to be cut in
half.</p>

<p>Bateman says
that these insights could lead to a different way of writing prescriptions for
women who?ve had cesarean deliveries.</p>




<h2>An
opioid crisis</h2>

<p>Bateman told
Healthline that he and his colleagues decided to embark on the studies after
seeing a wide degree of variability in the way opioids were being prescribed.
This led the research team to ask the question of what exactly constitutes an
appropriate prescription, as well as how much patients are actually taking of
the opioids they?ve been prescribed.</p>

<p>?In most
countries outside of the U.S., opioids are not necessarily prescribed following
cesarean delivery,? he said.
?In many countries, the standard approach after discharge is to treat pain with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen. I think the U.S.
stands out in terms of routinely prescribing opioids.?</p>

<p>?Across all
of clinical medicine, opioids are more widely used in the U.S. compared with
other countries. It?s just something about the way medicine has developed over
the last couple of decades in the U.S. This country certainly uses far more
than its fair share of opioids.?</p>




<h2>Several
important findings</h2>

<p>The research
led to some significant takeaways for Bateman?s research team.</p>

<p>The first
finding was that the amount of opioids that are prescribed doesn?t match well
with what patients actually consume. With patients only consuming half of what
they?ve been dispensed on average, this means that there?s a large amount of
leftover medications ? leading to the potential for misuse or diversion.</p>

<p>Researchers
also noted that, the more patients were prescribed, the more opiates they would
take, regardless of their characteristics or pain scores.</p>

<p>?I think
this really suggests that as physicians, we set patients? expectations as to
how much they should be taking by the amount that we prescribe,? said Bateman.
?If we prescribe a very large amount of opioids, patients assume they?re
supposed to take a large amount, and if we prescribe a smaller amount, patients
assume they?re supposed to take smaller amounts.?</p>

<p>It?s also
worth noting that patients who were prescribed more opioids didn?t see a
difference in pain scores vs. those who?d been prescribed less. In fact,
patients who took high dosages experienced more opioid-related side effects.</p>

<p>?This data
suggests, really, that prescribing more leads to taking more, but it doesn?t
improve either patient satisfaction or pain scores,? Bateman told Healthline.
?But it does lead to a higher rate of some of the adverse effects that are
associated with opioids.</p>

<p>The findings
from the shared decision-making study suggest that patients don?t necessarily
want to be prescribed large amounts of opioids.</p>

<p>?We found
that when we gave patients information about what other patients like them
typically consumed, the risks and benefits of opioids, and the expected
trajectory of the resolution of their pain symptoms, patients chose to be
prescribed, on average, about half of the total opioid prescription,? said
Bateman.</p>

<h2>Next
steps</h2>

<p>Bateman says
he and his colleagues are interested in further exploring the shared
decision-making approach.</p>

<p>To that end,
Bateman says, he?d like to further test and refine this approach. He told
Healthline, ?It?s potentially a really important way of better aligning what
patients are prescribed vs. what they actually use, and so we want to refine
this and find ways of scaling it in cesarean delivery.?</p>

health depends on eating well and exercising regularly. But some argue that may
not be enough.</p>

<p>?The secret to cracking into our inner
biology is as easy as leaving our comfort zones and seeking out just enough
environmental stress to make us stronger,? writes journalist and anthropologist
Scott Carney in his recent book, ?What
Doesn't Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude, and Environmental
Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength.?</p>

<p>By including this ?equally important, but
completely ignored, third pillar? in your daily routine, you can ?achieve big
results in very little time,? writes Carney.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind ?environmental
conditioning? is that for thousands of years humans lived without the comforts
of the modern world ? no central heating, no elevators, no thermal base layer
clothing.</p>

<p>Early humans hunted. They gathered. They fled
from predators trying to turn them into a quick snack. All while suffering
through snowstorms, heat waves, flooding, thunderstorms, and often a lack of
available food.</p>

<p>As a result, the human species adapted to
survive better in those extremes. Today we still carry many of the same genes
that helped us survive thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>Some think the latent abilities associated
with our early adaptations remain untapped.</p>

<p>?There?s an entire hidden physiology in our
bodies that operates on evolutionary programming most of us make no attempt to
unlock,? writes Carney.</p>

<p>So what will you find when you unlock this
physiological treasure trove?</p>

<p>Carney suggests environmental conditioning
can help you reconfigure your cardiovascular system and combat autoimmune
problems. And ?it is a pretty darned good method for simply losing weight,? he
writes.</p>

<p>In the book, it?s clear that Carney isn?t
just a reporter standing outside in his warm-and-woolies with a cup of hot
coffee in hand while he watches others gladly suffering for improved health.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/" target="_blank">Wim Hof</a> ? a Dutchman who advocates a mix
of environmental exposure and conscious breathing to gain control of our
involuntary physical responses ? Carney dives headfirst into this world of ice
baths and shirtless climbs up snow-covered mountain peaks.</p>



<h2>Research
on environmental conditioning</h2>

<p>For people who already push themselves hard ?
marathoners, triathletes, and Tough Mudders ? the idea that being too
comfortable could be bad for your health probably strikes a chord.</p>

<p>But can immersing yourself in the rawness of
the natural world really improve your health?</p>

<p>There is some research to back this up.</p>

<p>A 2015 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26147760" target="_blank">study</a> in Nature Medicine
found that 10 days of cold acclimation ? spending up to six hours per day at 59캟 (15캜) ?
boosted insulin sensitivity in eight men who were overweight and had type 2
diabetes. This change indicates a lessening of their disease symptoms.</p>

<p>Another study that year, published in the <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/67803" target="_blank">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, showed that exposure to 63캟 (17캜) for two hours per day for six
weeks decreases body fat. This study included 51 healthy young male volunteers.</p>

<p>There is even a 2014 study that supports
Hof?s method of using cold immersion and conscious breathing to voluntarily
control the immune system, which has long been thought to be beyond conscious
control. </p>

<p>Like the other two studies, this one
published in the journal <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.abstract" target="_blank">PNAS</a>, included a small number of subjects, which
concerns some researchers.</p>

<p>?For human variation studies, you really want
to have a great deal more than that. Working with just 24 people keeps you from
making any sort of correlations,? Jessica Brinkworth, PhD, an assistant
professor at the University of Illinois who studies the evolution of immune
function, told Healthline.</p>

<p>What?s missing from research in this area is
larger randomized studies that compare what happens to people undergoing
environmental conditioning for many weeks with a similar group going about
their normal routine.</p>

<p>And studies that compare the benefits of
environmental conditioning with other health interventions like aerobic or
strength exercises, mindfulness meditation by itself, or a diet of whole foods.</p>

<h2>Maximizing
immune potential</h2>

<p>Brinkworth also has concerns with how the
media sometimes spins the results of small studies and ?health gurus.?</p>

<p>?The notion that you can ?maximize your immunological
potential? is ludicrous,? she said. ?It?s not like weightlifting. And that?s
the way that it sometimes gets presented.?</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, our immune system
?is always actively engaged,? said Brinkworth ? it recalculates, reevaluates,
and reorganizes itself all the time.</p>

<p>Some things can weaken the immune system ?
chemotherapy, damage to the bone marrow, untreated HIV infection. </p>

<p>This can also be caused by a deficiency in
nutrients ? like zinc, vitamin C, or protein ? that the immune system needs to
function properly.</p>

<p>Even extreme calorie restriction can affect
immune function. This can happen by not eating enough food or by burning off
too many calories through extreme exercise or extended exposure to cold
temperatures.</p>

<p>?Immunity is the most expensive system we
have. It costs a lot of calories,? said Brinkworth. ?So it?s not very
surprising that in endurance athletes and people who are doing extreme
workouts, we see a down-regulation in immune function.?</p>

<p>There are two parts to the immune system. The
innate immune system protects the body from pathogens in a nonspecific way.
This includes immune cells like phagocytes and mast cells, but also the skin ?
which Brinkworth calls the ?largest immunological barrier that you have.?</p>

<p>Then there?s the adaptive immune system ?
which includes T and B cells. When this part of the immune system encounters a
specific pathogen, it produces an initial immune response, and remembers. If
the body runs into this pathogen again, the immune system will respond more
quickly and dramatically.</p>

<p>Brinkworth said that when the body is under
stress ? like during calorie restriction ? it can turn down the adaptive immune
response in order to save energy. </p>

<p>This has her concerned.</p>

<p>?You can make the argument that some of the
stuff that Hof is suggesting is dangerous,? said Brinkworth, ?because it would
potentially lead to this drop-down in adaptive responses if you did it
persistently.?</p>


<h2>Moderate
approach works, too</h2>

<p>Others echo her concerns.</p>

<p>?Why should we go to the extreme when we just
need to engage in exercise?? said Ellen Glickman, PhD, a professor of exercise
physiology, and a self-professed ?moderation person.?</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/exercise.htm" target="_blank">reports</a> that in 2015 less than 21
percent of American adults met the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for
both aerobic and strength training. </p>

<p>These guidelines are far from extreme ? at
least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and
muscle-strengthening activities two or more days per week.</p>

<p>Of course, some people are drawn to extreme
activities for the ?rush.? But that doesn?t mean less intense exercise isn?t
good for you.</p>

<p>Glickman said that aerobic exercise can be
?equally engaging? and offers many benefits, such as boosting cardiovascular
health, improving overall health and well-being, burning calories, and
increasing endorphins.</p>

<p>In addition, if you commute to an office
every day, it might be hard to find time to take on the cold outdoors.</p>

<p>?I don?t see how the extreme fits into our
health and well-being on a daily basis. Eating right and exercising does.
Balancing caloric intake and caloric expenditure does,? said Glickman. ?Extreme
sports, extreme anything doesn?t. Moderation does.?</p>

<p>Of course, spending time outside can be
beneficial even if you aren?t ice dunking or meditating in the snow in your
underwear.</p>

<p>Many <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/scientific-benefits-of-nature-outdoors-2016-4" target="_blank">studies</a> show that natural settings may
improve short-term memory, relieve stress, reduce inflammation, and help you
focus more.</p>



<h2>Should
we live like early humans?</h2>

<p>In the modern world, cut off from nature, we
sometimes forget that evolution and our past environments made the human
species what it is today.</p>

<p>?Evolution shapes health. Health is the
outcome of evolution,? said Brinkworth. ?That?s absolutely true.?</p>

<p>She stressed that evolution should definitely
guide how we treat diseases and help people stay healthy, ?but it needs to be
done informed with real biological information.?</p>

<p>Other scientists wonder whether or not living
like early humans makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<p>?The notion that we are adapted to a
Pleistocene environment, while it may contain some element of truth, is
unlikely to be a highly accurate description,? Kyle Summers, PhD, an
evolutionary biologist at East Carolina University, told Healthline.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch
came the Paleolithic Era ? which inspired the popular paleo diet. This era
lasted from roughly 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago and predates
agriculture.</p>

<p>Summers said that while ?substantial? change
occurred to the human genome during the Pleistocene period, ?there is also
likely to have been a significant amount of evolutionary change during our more
recent evolutionary history, including the 10,000 years or so since the origins
of agriculture.?</p>

<p>Add to that the challenge of knowing exactly
how early humans lived, said Summers, ?making any inferences about exactly what
environment humans adapted to even during the Pleistocene highly speculative.?</p>

<p>And human populations lived in vastly
different environments around the globe, which can make a big difference to
health.</p>

<p>?Latitude, seasonality, social environment,
and climate all affect immune function,? said Brinkworth.</p>

<p>Hof?s methods focus on cold environments.
Humans living in tropical areas for thousands of years, though, may have
different gene variants or physiological responses to cold than people from northern
latitudes.</p>

<p>There are other factors that shaped the human
species, as well.</p>

<p>In particular, said Brinkworth, infectious
pathogens are the ?number one driver, as far as we can tell, of immune
function.?</p>

<p>Environmental conditioning has its
proponents, but others caution a healthy dose of skepticism.</p>

<p>?While I think ideas from the paleo community
may have some merit in some contexts,? said Summers, ?it is hard to separate
the valid ideas from those that are too speculative and unsupported.?</p>

<p>There?s also the risk of going too far. Being
too much like a Paleo human may not be all that it?s cracked up to be.</p><p>

?If you want to be living in rough circumstances
and deliberately stressing yourself long-term and avoiding modern medicines and
modern concepts of hygiene,? said Brinkworth, ?you?re going to have the same
lifespan as other members of the [early] Homo genus ? that?s 30 to 35 years.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-16T10:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-16T10:00:00</updateddate><category>Fitness and Exercise</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/third-pillar-of-physical-fitness</guid><dc:date>2017-06-16T10:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Living Hard on the Weekends Can Wreck Your Health</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/living-hard-on-the-weekends-can-wreck-your-health </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Live hard on weekends, and your health may
pay the price. </p>

<p>This phenomenon called ?social jet lag? ?
where much-needed sleep patterns are upset ? is linked to increased fatigue,
worse moods, and even heart disease and obesity.</p>

<p>?It?s like having jet lag or doing
globetrotting,? said Orfeu Buxton, an associate professor in the Department of
Biobehavioral Health at Pennsylvania State University. ?An irregular schedule
is a health risk in itself. If you?re out of synch, it?s a cacophony.? </p>

<p>Even a little social jet lag, it turns out,
has negative consequences.</p>

<p>Each hour of social jet lag is linked to an
11 percent increase in the likelihood of heart disease, according to a new <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170605085326.htm" target="_blank">study</a> presented at the Associated
Professional Sleep Societies. And all age groups are equally affected, not just
the young.</p>



<h2>Body
clock loves regularity</h2>

<p>The term <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/your-alarm-clock-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health-164620290/" target="_blank">social jet lag</a> was coined by researcher Till
Roenneberg, a professor at the Institute of Medical Psychology at the
University of Munich. He likens it to flying from Paris to New York one day,
and then a few days later flying to Tokyo. With jet lag, though, the body
clock, which is sensitive to darkness and light changes, catches up faster when
you reach a destination. With no such signals, social jet lag can grab hold
longer. </p>

<p>Lay the blame on circadian rhythms, an internal
body clock that thrives on regularity. Going to sleep and waking at the same
time works well. And these regular cycles play a big part in keeping us
healthy.</p>

<p>All mammals have circadian rhythms. And they
govern sleep cycles, hormone releases, and other body functions. They can even
orchestrate the gut, which is increasingly seen as the key to good health.
Social jet lag, however, introduces noise into the system and influences the
body clock. </p>

<p>?Sleep and circadian rhythms also play a big
role in heart health,? said Michael Grandner, PhD, director of the Sleep and
Health Research Program at the University of Arizona, and a senior author of
the study. ?People with insomnia, for example, have increased risk of heart
disease.?</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease even has its own
arrhythmia called holiday heart, that occurs around times such as New Year?s,
said Dr. Nicole Weinberg, a cardiologist at Providence Saint John?s Health Center
in Santa Monica, Calif. When living hard is frequent, you can ?get stuck with arrhythmia
issues,? she said.</p>

<p>Shift workers who work at night or on
rotating shifts can especially suffer from <a href="/health/circadian-rhythm-sleep-disorder">sleep disorders</a>, according to studies. These
workers are more likely to have higher diabetes and heart attack risks. ?They
don?t live as long,? said Buxton.</p>

<p>Off-kilter body clocks can even affect work
time. Annually, the United States loses about 1.23 million working days due to
poor sleep. It?s also linked to higher mortality risks, according to a <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1791.html" target="_blank">Rand study</a>. </p>



<h2>Sleep
is an investment</h2>

<p>Yes, the body can reset. But not always
quickly when making up for longer sleep disruptions. Hormones like cortisol take
a while to process, said Weinberg.</p>

<p>?So you can feel the residual effects from
social jet lag for weeks,? she added. ?It doesn?t get better in the blink of an
eye.?</p>

<p>The remedy? Getting back to a regular sleep
schedule, actually, and sticking to it. </p>

<p>?Seven hours of continuous sleep is the magic
number,? said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor at the University of
California Keck School. ?You need that to get into a state of deep sleep.? </p>

<p>Even meditation won?t help, he said. ?No
amount of it will change the circadian rhythms,? he added. </p>

<p>The upshot is that sleep is an excellent
health marker, said Buxton. ?If you?re sleeping well, chances are that other
things are going well too,? he said, ?and you?re less likely to exercise
irregularly.? So along with sleep at the same times, eating well and exercising
are important too.</p>

<p>How do you know if you?re descending into
social jet lag? ?If you?re dragging during the day,? said Grandner. ?A lot of
people are chasing energy and not finding it.? He suggests thinking of sleep as
an investment in time. ?We?re all trying to get the most out of our day,? he
said. </p>

<p>Binging and squeezing the most out of every
moment isn?t productive, Buxton agreed. ?Slow down a bit and prioritize sleep
and healthy behaviors,? he added. ?Subtle changes in regularity have a strong
effect.? </p>

miles. As director of supply chain and logistics for an international
corporation, she travels weekly for both work and pleasure, frequently hopping
time zones.</p>

<p>All that travel, combined with a busy work
schedule, makes Godlove a prime candidate for a <a href="/health/circadian-rhythm-sleep-disorder">circadian rhythm disorder</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/circadian-rhythm-disorders" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a> defines circadian rhythm
disorders as, ?disruptions in a person?s circadian rhythm ? a name given to the
?internal body clock? that regulates the (approximately) 24-hour cycle of
biological processes in animals and plants ? The key feature of circadian
rhythm disorders is a continuous or occasional disruption of sleep patterns.? </p>

<p>These disorders can happen as a result of a
malfunction of the internal body clock, as is the case with <a href="/health/narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a>, or as the result of external factors
contributing to erratic sleep timing. This is the case with shift work disorder
and the most common circadian rhythm disorder: jet lag. </p>

<p>For those who struggle with circadian rhythm
disorders, that disruption of sleep patterns can result in both insomnia and
excessive sleepiness, as well as social impairment and struggles completing
daily tasks. </p>

<p>But what can a person like Godlove do to
combat those issues if their sleep pattern is continuously being interrupted?</p>



<h2>Altering
your internal ?body clock? with food</h2>

<p>That?s a question two recent reports aim to
answer. The first, released from the <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/uos-dmi053117.php" target="_blank">University of Surrey</a>, explores the impact of delaying
meals in order to alleviate the symptoms of jet lag and shift work. In what is
being touted as the first human study of its kind, Dr. Jonathan Johnston and
Dr. Sophie Wehrens attempted to alter mealtimes for test subjects in order to
see if doing so could reset body clocks.</p>

<p>The results were promising, indicating that
mealtimes do synchronize internal clocks and can impact the flow of blood sugar
concentration. These delays did not affect insulin levels, and may be the key
to addressing jet lag and shift work concerns. </p>

<p>Healthline spoke to Miranda Willetts, a
registered dietitian and wellness coach, about the latest findings. She was
intrigued, but was also quick to point to issues within the study. ?The sample
size and population in this study are limited [10 young, healthy men], so it?s
hard to say whether or not timed meals might actually help in practice. Not to
mention, the individual would have to eat three isocaloric meals that contained
identical macronutrients and were perfectly timed. These are not easy
conditions to execute in the real-word.?</p>

<p>For her part, Godlove told Healthline she
could see how meal timing could be impactful. ?I typically have breakfast early
in the morning Central time before going to the airport. On travel days, I
might not then get lunch until 3 p.m. CST. At this point I am in a food
emergency and typically make poor choices in my selection because I?m in an
unfamiliar location and pressed for time once I land. I find this study really
interesting, and it makes me want to be more aware of my scheduled meals while
on the road. It would take some planning to make it work, but I do think it?s
possible.?</p>



<h2>Advanced preparation to
reset circadian rhythm</h2>

<p>Perfectly
timing meals isn?t the only way to possibly limit the symptoms of a circadian
rhythm disorder, though. The <a href="http://medschool.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=1158&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=1055" target="_blank">second report</a> to be released recently
acknowledges that there is no way to completely eliminate jet lag, but there
are things people can do to reduce the effects. A few items on that list
include:</p>

<ul><li>taking low dose (.5 mg) melatonin
supplements</li><li>taking sleep medications used on
arrival for three consecutive nights, starting with the first night of sleep
after travel </li><li>anticipating the time change and
slowly shifting your own routine around that change (getting up later and going
to bed earlier, for instance) in the days leading up to travel</li><li>avoiding alcohol and caffeine at
least three to four hours before bedtime</li></ul>







<p>The
goal in avoiding jet lag, it would seem, is acclimating yourself to the new
time zone as early as possible. Sometimes even days before you leave. This does
tie into the potential benefit of timed meals, as well. If we can adjust our
body?s expectation of when food will arrive, perhaps we can convince our bodies
to accept the newest time zone sooner. </p>

<p>While
jet lag and shift work disorder aren?t the only circadian rhythm disorders,
they are the most common. And this latest research suggests that while
completely avoiding them might not be possible, reducing the risks and getting
your body adjusted to a new time zone may not be as difficult as once believed.
</p>

<p>Of
course, Healthline had to follow up with Willetts with one simple question. How
should someone struggling with a circadian rhythm disorder process this newest
information? </p>

<p>This
is what she had to say: ?If someone had a circadian rhythm disorder, I?d
recommend working with a registered dietitian to create, and experiment with, a
realistic plan for meal timing that takes some of the findings from this study
into consideration.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-15T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-15T16:00:00</updateddate><category>General Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/beating-jet-lag-how-the-latest-research-might-help</guid><dc:date>2017-06-15T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>White or Whole Wheat Bread Study May Shed Light on Diet Failure</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/bread-study-may-shed-light-on-diet-failure </link><description><![CDATA[<p>In a new
study, researchers discovered that different people?s bodies react differently
to the same foods, which could be a breakthrough in understanding why dieting,
for millions, hasn?t worked.</p>

<p>Researchers
at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, based their study on the nutritional
and glycemic effects of eating two different types of bread. Their findings
were published on June 6 in the journal <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30288-7" target="_blank">Cell
Metabolism</a>.</p>

<p>After decades
of studies on which breads are healthiest, it remained unclear what effect
bread and different bread types have on different systems in the body,
especially the microbiome, which encompasses the millions of microorganisms
that naturally live on and in the human body. </p>

<p>One of the
researchers? new findings is that there is no clinical difference in the
effects of ingesting white or wheat bread.</p>

<p>The
researchers came to this conclusion after performing a crossover study of 20
adults. Processed white bread was introduced into the diets of half of the
subjects, while the other half ate handmade, whole-wheat sourdough bread.</p>




<p>In addition,
researchers found that the composition of the subjects? microbiomes was
generally resilient to the dietary intervention of bread, and that the glycemic
response (the effect on glucose, or blood sugar, levels) to the two bread types
varies greatly among the population.</p>

<p>Dr. Eran
Elinav, a researcher in the Department of Immunology at the Weizmann Institute,
and one of the study's senior authors, said these findings were ?fascinating?
and ?potentially very important.? </p>

<p>?To date,
the nutritional values assigned to food have been based on minimal science, and
one-size-fits-all diets have failed miserably,? he said. </p>

<p>Eran Segal, PhD,
a computational biologist at Weizmann, and another senior author, told
Healthline they also performed a crossover
clinical trial where subjects were compared with themselves. The results were
?very powerful? as it compared short-term effects of interventions.</p>

<p>?Subjects were compared to themselves,? he explained. ?We compared
increased short-term (one week) consumption of industrial white bread vs.
matched consumption of artisanal sourdough-leavened whole-wheat bread, which we
originally viewed as radical opposites in terms of their health benefits.?</p>

<p>The researchers also measured various clinical end points, including
weight, blood pressure, various blood tests, and the gut microbiome.</p>




<h2>No difference between white and wheat? </h2>

<p>To their surprise, Segal said they found no difference between the
effects those two breads had on the various end points they measured. They
combined and analyzed data on the two bread types, testing whether bread of any
type had an effect. </p>

<p>The scientists found that just one week of bread consumption after
eating no bread resulted in statistically significant changes to multiple
clinical parameters, he said. </p>

<p>?We saw a reduction in essential minerals in the blood (calcium,
magnesium, iron) and an increase in LDH (lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of
tissue damage),? Segal said. ?But we also saw an improvement in markers of
liver and kidney function, inflammation markers, and cholesterol levels.?</p>

<p>In the microbiome, he said they found only a minimal difference between
the effects of the different breads ? two microbial taxa (groups of organisms),
that were increased with white bread. But, generally they saw that the
microbiome was very resilient to this intervention.</p>

<p>?This is surprising, as the current paradigm in the field is that a
change in nutrition rapidly changes the makeup of the microbiome,? Segal said.
?This is probably dependent on the kind of change. We had a nutritional change
that was significant enough to change clinical parameters, which we tend to think
of as very stable. And yet it had a minimal effect on the microbiome.?</p>

<h2>Personal responses</h2>

<p>The
researchers were also co-authors of a paper published in 2015 in the journal <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6" target="_blank">Cell</a>. In that study they observed the nutritional habits
of 900 people. The researchers found that bread was the single most consumed
food item in their diets, making up roughly 10 percent of their caloric intake.</p>

<p>In
their latest study, participants also normally received about 10 percent of
their calories from bread, Segal said. Half were assigned to consume an
increased amount of processed, packaged white bread for a week (about 25
percent of their calories), and half were assigned to eat an increased amount
of whole-wheat sourdough. The fresh wheat bread was baked specifically for the
participants and delivered to them. Then, after two weeks without bread, the
diets for each group were reversed.</p>

<p>Segal
said they monitored numerous health effects before and during the study. These
included the subjects? glucose levels upon waking up; their levels of the
essential minerals calcium, iron, and magnesium; fat and cholesterol levels;
kidney and liver enzymes; and markers for inflammation and tissue damage. </p>

<p>The team also
measured the composition of the subjects? microbiomes before, during, and after
the study.</p>

<p>?In fact, half the people had higher glycemic responses to white bread,
and the other half had higher responses to sourdough bread,? Segal said. ?We
also proved rigorously that this was statistically significant and not a result
of random fluctuations.?</p>

<p>?So, having very personal, often opposite responses, to the same kind of
bread poses a problem. How would we know, in advance, which type of food is
better for each person?? </p>




<h2>Getting enough vitamins and
nutrients</h2>

<p>The scientists created a
prediction algorithm: ?We showed that we could have predicted, with fairly good
accuracy, which bread induces lower glycemic responses for each subject
personally, and did that based on their initial microbiome configurations,?
Segal said. </p>

<p>?This is one very important way
in which the food we eat affects our metabolism,? he said. ?High glucose
responses are a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and liver cirrhosis. It is also associated with
obesity, and enhanced all-cause mortality in both type 2 diabetes and cancer.?</p>

<p>Using personalized medicine has become increasingly popular in medicine,
but using this technique for diets could potentially mark a shift in how
nutritionists work with patients. </p>

<p>Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, LD, told Healthline that rather than giving
universal dietary recommendations, nutrition advice
is most effective when tailored specifically to the person, ?considering
metabolic characteristics, microbiota, food allergies or sensitivities, insulin
and glucose sensitivities, and genes, if applicable.?</p>

<p>Kirkpatrick, also the manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at the
Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute in Ohio, has co-authored ?Skinny Liver: A
Proven Program to Prevent and Reverse the New Silent Epidemic ? Fatty Liver
Disease.? She said despite the findings in this small study, a longer-term
study is needed.</p>

<p>?The findings in this study are based on two 1-week-long
interventions. A small snapshot in time,? she said. ?It may not be indicative
of the potential nutrition effects that can take weeks, months, or even years
to be seen and quantified.?</p>

<p>The study also brings up a question. Which is
better bread: processed white or fresh, whole-wheat sourdough?</p>

<p>There are certain facts about whole-grain
bread vs. white bread that support healthier overall nutrition, regardless of
glycemic response, Kirkpatrick said.</p>

<p>?We know that the processing [milling] of
intact grains to white flour removes layers of essential nutrition: B vitamins,
minerals, proteins, healthy fats, and fiber in the bran and germ layers
removed,? she said. ?This leaves the white flour with only the endosperm,
containing all the starch without a lot of nutrient density.? </p>

<p>So, even if glycemic responses after
ingestion were the same, she added, study participants most likely would still
miss out on those these vital nutrients if they chose white bread over whole
wheat. </p>

<h2>The role of the microbiome</h2>

<p>How did the Weizmann team
measure the makeup of microbiomes? Some trips to the bathroom and a little help
from their smartphones. </p>

<p>Stool samples were collected
from participants at several points during the study. Segal said they extracted
DNA from the samples, and analyzed the DNA sequence of the microbes in the
stool. </p>

<p>?To identify the source of
each of these DNA sequences, we matched it with databases of known DNA
sequences of different bacteria known to reside in the gut,? he said.</p>

<p>Participants also used a
smartphone app, developed by the scientists, to log their bread intake in
real-time. </p>

<p>Called the Personalized
Nutrition Project, the app analyzes the microbiome to predict sugar responses
to thousands of different foods. Originally developed for the team?s previous
2012 study, the app was licensed and is now marketed by <a href="https://www.daytwo.com/" target="_blank">DayTwo</a>.</p>

<p>The study raised questions
that Segal, Elinav, and their colleagues are exploring now. Which genetic
mechanisms drive differences between people? What biological mechanisms in the
microbiome drive differences between people? </p>

<p>?If ?one-size-fits-all?
diets do not work,? Segal said, ?how can we better personalize diets? We are
currently conducting research to answer some of these questions.?</p>

<p>?We need more research to
establish precisely how the microbiome affects how people respond to food. But,
we envision a future where each of us would have their microbiome profiled, and
then receive personal nutrition advice based on it.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-15T15:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-15T15:00:00</updateddate><category>Food and Nutrition</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/bread-study-may-shed-light-on-diet-failure</guid><dc:date>2017-06-15T15:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Reducing Saturated Fat Just as Effective as Statins for Heart Health</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/reducing-saturated-fat-just-as-effective-as-statins-for-heart-health </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Cardiovascular disease continues to be the
top killer in the United States. A new review from the American Heart
Association reiterates the importance of replacing saturated fats with
unsaturated ones to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=463732" target="_blank">Saturated fats</a> are known to raise cholesterol
levels and increase cardiovascular risk. Meat, full-fat and reduced fat dairy
products, and fried foods, as well as bakery products, all have a <a href="https://healthyforgood.heart.org/Eat-smart/Articles/Saturated-Fats" target="_blank">high content of saturated fats</a>. </p>



<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to
be the leading cause of mortality across the U.S., accounting for approximately
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm" target="_blank">1
in 4</a> yearly deaths.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One of the main prevention <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/Diet-and-Lifestyle-Recommendations_UCM_305855_Article.jsp#.WUJbGBPyvMI" target="_blank">guidelines</a> for CVD is to reduce the dietary
intake of saturated fats and reduce cholesterol. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744652/" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown that replacing saturated
fats with unsaturated ones can lower the risk of CVD, and that following a diet
rich in vegetables, fish, and whole grains is key for keeping the heart
healthy. </p>


<p>However, other studies have questioned the
strategy of replacing saturated fats with unsaturated ones. The argument goes
that limiting saturated fats may increase a person?s intake of carbohydrates,
sugar, and calories. </p>



<p>Inconsistencies persist, even in the official
guidelines regarding saturated fat intake. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans recommend that saturated fats should make up no more than <a href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines-answers-your-questions" target="_blank">10 percent</a> of a person?s
overall calorie intake, whereas the American Heart Association (AHA)/American
College of Cardiology Dietary Guidelines propose reducing this to <a href="https://healthyforgood.heart.org/Eat-smart/Articles/Saturated-Fats" target="_blank">5 or 6 percent</a>.</p>







<h2>A
New Look at Existing Data</h2>

<p>Now, the AHA have conducted a new review of
the existing evidence on the effect of saturated fats in our diets. The new
advisory, published in the journal <em>Circulation</em>,
reaffirms the benefit of unsaturated fats in one?s diet.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Dr.
Frank Sacks, the lead author of the advisory and a professor of cardiovascular disease
prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, MA, further
explains the motivation for this analysis: </p>



<p>?We
want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research
overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases
of the heart and blood vessels,? he says. ?Saturated fat increases LDL [low-density
lipoprotein] ? bad cholesterol ? which is a major cause of artery-clogging
plaque and cardiovascular disease.? </p>







<h2>Limiting
saturated fat intake has same effect as taking statins</h2>

<p>The AHA <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=176331&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_blank">recommend</a> replacing saturated fats with mono-
and polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in the Mediterranean diet and the
Dietary Approaches To Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet.</p>



<p>Both
of these diets consist mainly of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated vegetable
oils, nuts, low-fat dairy, and whole grains, as well as fish and poultry. The
Mediterranean and DASH diets also limit red meat, sugar, and salt intake. </p>



<p>The AHA meta-review of existing randomized
controlled trials found that restricting dietary saturated fat and replacing it
with polyunsaturated vegetable oil lowered CVD risk by approximately a third. </p>



<p>Making this dietary change accounted for a
30 percent decrease in CVD risk, which is roughly the equivalent of what
statins ? a class of drug generally prescribed to lower cholesterol ? can
achieve. </p>


<p>Polyunsaturated fats are commonly found in
oils made from corn, soybean, and peanut, among others.</p>



<p>Coconut oil, on the other hand, has been
shown by several studies to increase ?bad? cholesterol levels just as much as products
such as beef or butter do.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Additionally, the review found that
observational studies indicated that reduced intake of saturated fat, together
with a higher consumption of mono- and polyunsaturated fat, correlates with
lower odds of developing CVD. </p>



<p>The AHA also caution that replacing
saturated fats with refined carbohydrates and sugars does not lower the risk of
CVD:</p>



<p>?A
healthy diet doesn?t just limit certain unfavorable nutrients, such as
saturated fats, that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other
blood vessel diseases,? Sacks continues. ?It should also focus on healthy foods
rich in nutrients that can help reduce disease risk, like poly- and
mono-unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish,
and others.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-15T11:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-15T11:00:00</updateddate><category>Food and Nutrition</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/reducing-saturated-fat-just-as-effective-as-statins-for-heart-health</guid><dc:date>2017-06-15T11:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Gynecologists Slam Online Recommendation to Put Wasp Nests in Vagina</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/gynecologists-slam-etsy-recommendation-to-put-wasp-nests-in-vagina </link><description><![CDATA[<p>First
there was Goop, now there are galls.</p>

<p>Oak
galls, to be precise. These little balls, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, are found
in oak trees. They?re made up of bark and chemicals injected by the larva of
certain types of gall wasps.</p>

<p>Now,
they?ve found their way onto Etsy, the e-commerce site that specializes in
handmade and vintage items, as a supposed homeopathic way to tighten a woman?s
vagina.</p>

<p>It?s
far from the first time that dubious medical advice has gone viral. And this
purported remedy has health professionals shaking their heads.</p>

<h2>Strong condemnation</h2>

<p>Jen
Gunter, OB-GYN and pain medicine physician, sounded the alarm over the oak gall
advice on her <a href="https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/dont-put-ground-up-wasp-nest-in-your-vagina/" target="_blank">personal blog</a> in a post last month, ?Don?t put ground up
wasp nest in your vagina.?</p>

<p>Gunter
notes that salicylate, the phenolic acid found in many types of tree bark, has
been used to treat pain and fever for centuries. But putting astringents
directly in one?s vagina, as the Etsy page recommends, is a definite no-go.</p>

<p>?This
product follows the same dangerous pathway of other ?traditional? vaginal
practices, meaning tightening and drying the vagina, which is both medically
and sexually (for women, anyway) undesirable,? she wrote in her blog.</p>

<p>?Drying
the vaginal mucosa increases the risk of abrasions during sex (not good) and
destroys the protective mucous layer (not good). It could also wreak havoc with
the good bacteria. In addition to causing pain during sex it can increase the
risk of HIV transmission. This is a dangerous practice with real potential to
harm. Here?s a pro-tip, if something burns when you apply it to the vagina it
is generally bad for the vagina.?</p>



<h2>No shortage of dubious
health information online</h2>

<p>While
the oak gall therapy came from an Etsy seller and not a celebrity, it?s part of
a broader trend of <a href="/health-news/celebrity-health-advice">questionable health advice</a> that tends to spread online.</p>

<p>Often,
this advice gets a wide audience because it came from a celebrity.</p>

<p>Case
in point: Earlier this year, Gwyneth Paltrow touted the <a href="http://goop.com/better-sex-jade-eggs-for-your-yoni/" target="_blank">purported benefits</a> of women putting jade eggs in their vagina.</p>

<p>This
recommendation, published in Paltrow?s online health newsletter, Goop, attracted widespread
condemnation from physicians.</p>

<p>A gynecologist
interviewed by Healthline said that while Paltrow?s heart might be in the right
place, she isn?t qualified to give such recommendations.</p>

<p>?Everyone
in this world has their gift, and for Gwyneth Paltrow that gift is acting,? Dr.
Christine Greves of Orlando Health?s Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, told
Healthline.</p>

<p>?[Paltrow]
seems to have a good heart, and many people might see her health advice as
well-intentioned and will want to follow it. But it?s incredibly important to ask,
?Is this backed by a physician?s recommendations or not? Is it FDA approved??
Ultimately, it?s best to talk to your physician before trying out a remedy you
see online.?</p>

<p>In a
<a href="https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/if-gwyneth-paltrow-is-so-effing-tired-maybe-she-shouldnt-put-jade-eggs-in-her-vagina/" target="_blank">March blog post</a>, Gunter slammed the magazine Women?s Health for putting Paltrow on
the cover and publishing some of her problematic health advice.</p>

<p>Gunter
broke down some of her issues with Paltrow?s advice, writing, ?Her advice on
iodine could kill someone. Everyone is not suffering from chronic yeast
infections that only some private doctor?s diet can cure. Using vaginal jade
eggs could injure your pelvic floor. Bras will not give you breast cancer. If
this is what Women?s Health<em> </em>is
okay calling wellness then they are either a simpering pandering pile of trash
trying to cash in on the Paltrow crazy train, or they really believe there are
toxins everywhere.?</p>



<h2>When in doubt, trust a
professional</h2>

<p>While
it may be tempting to try out a new remedy you read about online, it?s always
best to consult with your doctor beforehand.</p>

<p>It?s
worth noting, Greves says, that doctors aren?t going to automatically reject a
potential therapy just because it?s homeopathic in nature.</p>

<p>?It?s
important for people to realize that when they?re talking to their physician,
that physician isn?t necessarily going to pooh-pooh their ideas,? she told
Healthline. ?In fact, there are many homeopathic remedies that are advisable,
depending of course on the patient?s condition.?</p>

<p>?All
we can really do is advise our patients and try to educate them on the risks of
potential treatments.?</p>

Blame Your Brain</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/still-hungry-after-dinner-blame-your-brain </link><description><![CDATA[<p>When hunger
strikes, simply seeing a picture of a cheeseburger or a pizza may be enough to
get you running to the nearest diner. But if you?re still tempted by these
visual cues after eating a large meal, a new study suggests that it may be down
to faulty brain wiring, rather than a lack of willpower.</p>



<p>Researchers from the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA, have uncovered how
neurons in the insular cortex of the brain influence how we respond to food
cues.</p>



<p>What is more, the researchers found that it may be
possible to control the activity of these neurons and alter eating habits, a
discovery that could lead to new treatment strategies for eating disorders and
obesity.</p>



<p>Study co-author Mark Andermann, Ph.D., of the Division
of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at BIDMC, and colleagues recently
reported their <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22375" target="_blank">findings</a> in
the journal <em>Nature</em>. </p>



<p>Previous studies have suggested that the insular
cortex affects our behavior in response to food cues, such as food-related
television commercials. </p>



<p>The researchers explain that in healthy individuals
who are hungry, activity in the insular cortex increases in response to food
cues, but it does not increase in response to such cues after a large meal.</p>



<p>However, brain imaging studies have indicated that
individuals who are obese or have eating disorders may possess abnormalities in
the insular cortex that increase their sensitivity to food cues, which may
explain why some people overeat.</p>








<h2>Studying
the insular cortex of mice</h2>



<p>For their study, Dr. Andermann and colleagues set out
to gain a better understanding of the brain activity that influences eating
behavior in response to food cues.</p>



<p>To reach their findings, the researchers studied the
insular cortex of mouse models.</p>



<p>In mice, the insular cortex is hard to reach, but Dr. Andermann
and team developed a tiny periscope that allowed them to assess neuronal
activity within this brain region.</p>



<p>Using this novel tool, the researchers analyzed
neuronal activity in the rodents? insular cortex in response to food cues in
two conditions: when they were hungry and when they were sated.</p>



<p>The team found that when the mice were hungry, food
cues led to the activation of a group of neurons in the insular cortex that
influenced food-seeking behavior. When the mice were sated, however, these
neurons were not activated.</p>








<h2>Food-seeking
behavior in sated mice triggered by ArGP neurons</h2>



<p>Using genetic and optical techniques, the researchers then ?switched on?
neurons in the hypothalamus that express the gene for Agouti-related protein (AgRP). Activating these AgRP neurons
promotes hunger.</p>



<p>The team found that activating the AgRP neurons not only caused sated
mice to seek food in response to food cues, but it led to neuronal activity in the
insular cortex comparable to that of hungry mice. </p>



<p>"These AgRP neurons cause hunger ? they are the
quintessential hunger neuron," says study co-author Dr. Bradford B.
Lowell, also of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at
BIDMC.</p>



<p>"It's a major advance to learn that we can
artificially turn them on and cause full mice to work to get food and to eat as
if they hadn't eaten in a long time. These neurons seem capable of causing a
diverse set of behaviors associated with hunger and eating."</p>



<p>The research also revealed that the brain pathway that
connects AgRP neurons and the insular cortex involves the amygdala and paraventricular thalamus. The amygdala is involved in
modifying the value of food cues, while the paraventricular thalamus plays a
role in motivational behavior.</p>



<p>While further research is needed to gain a clearer
understanding of the brain processes involved in behavioural responses to food
cues, Dr. Andermann and colleagues believe that their current findings have
therapeutic potential.</p>



<p>For example, the team suggests that it may be possible
to reduce AgRP neuron activity in order to combat food cravings triggered by food
cues, which may help to treat obesity.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-14T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-14T16:00:00</updateddate><category>Strange Science</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/still-hungry-after-dinner-blame-your-brain</guid><dc:date>2017-06-14T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Is Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research in Jeopardy?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-human-embryonic-stem-cell-research-in-jeopardy </link><description><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, when renowned stem cell
scientist Lawrence Goldstein, PhD, published his groundbreaking
book ?Stem Cells for Dummies,? with co-author Meg Schneider, the forecast for
human embryonic stem cell research had just begun to brighten.</p>

<p>In 2001, former President George
W. Bush cast a cloud over this field of science by barring the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from
funding research that used embryonic stem cells beyond the 60 cell lines that
already existed.
</p>

<p>But in 2009, then-President
Barack Obama signed an executive order repealing Bush?s policy.</p>

<p>Obama?s decision enabled
researchers like Goldstein, director of the UC
San Diego Stem Cell Program, and Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center, to
make real progress, inching closer to human clinical trials.</p>

<p>Goldstein?s work focuses on
discovering clinical applications for human embryonic stem cells, also known as
ESC. </p>

<p>His work looks
specifically at clinical applications for neurodegenerative diseases such as <em>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</em> (ALS), and Alzheimer?s,
Parkinson?s, and Huntington?s diseases.</p>

<p>?After 10 years, we?ve seen a variety of
projects that use embryonic stem cells moving closer to clinical applications
and in clinical trials,? Goldstein told Healthline.</p>

<p>?Although it?s taken some time, we?re getting
closer to seeing the most promising approach for treatment of different
neurologic disorders that have no suitable treatment alternative.?</p>




<h2>Embryonic stem cells under fire</h2>

<p>But now use of human embryonic stem cells are
once again under fire from conservative and pro-life groups.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, human embryonic
stem cells do not come from aborted fetuses. </p>

<p>All the human embryonic stem cell lines
currently in use are derived from
unused embryos developed for in vitro fertilization and donated for research. </p>

<p>They are cells
that would have only been discarded.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,
their use in research is opposed by many in the pro-life movement, including a
vocal coalition in Congress.</p>

<p>Last month, 41 conservatives in the House
urged President Trump to fire Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, the
world?s largest agency funding biomedical research, because Collins supports
embryonic stem cell research. </p>

<p>However,
Trump announced last week he was reappointing Collins, a widely respected physician-geneticist.</p>

<p>Several Republican leaders in
Congress had reportedly urged Trump to retain him, calling Collins ?the right
person, at the right time, to continue to lead the world?s premiere biomedical
research agency.? </p>

<p>But Trump?s
decision didn?t sit well with many in his voting base and his own cabinet.</p>

<p>Vice
President Mike Pence, and Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, have
both spoken out against the use of embryonic stem cells on moral grounds. </p>

<p>Just a few
weeks ago, Pence got a standing ovation at the National Catholic Prayer
Breakfast when he reminded the audience that he was the one who cast the ?tie-breaking
vote in the United States Senate that allowed states to defund Planned
Parenthood.?</p>

<p>The
Congressional conservatives who called on Trump to fire Collins are voicing
their anger over Trump?s decision to retain Collins.</p>

<p>Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., told LifeNews, a
pro-life publication, that he was ?disappointed? in the Trump Administration?s
decision.</p>

<p>?Dr. Collins? support of embryonic stem cell
research, along with his comments that cloned embryos do not deserve the same
moral protections as ?naturally generated embryos,? make him a less than an
ideal fit for a pro-life administration,? Banks said. ?I am hopeful that Dr.
Collins will turn away from embryo-killing research as he continues his tenure
as NIH director.?</p>

<h2>Return to dark age solution?</h2>

<p>Trump?s election has resulted in a new and
unprecedentedly tenuous era for the NIH. Its funding has typically had
bipartisan support.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Despite Trump?s seemingly pro-science pivot,
the NIH still faces a potential <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/trump-wants-2018-nih-cut-come-overhead-payments" target="_blank">$5.8 billion</a> cut ? about 18 prevent ? in the
president?s fiscal 2018 budget. </p>

<p>And this plank from the 2016 GOP platform
remains in place: </p>

<p>?We oppose embryonic stem cell research. We oppose
federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. We support adult stem cell
research and urge the restoration of the national placental stem cell bank
created by President George H.W. Bush but abolished by his Democratic
successor, President Bill Clinton.?</p>

<p>Goldstein and several other scientists
interviewed for this story said that while Trump?s decision to retain Collins
is a positive, there?s still no guarantee that embryonic stem cell research
will continue getting support from the federal government in this increasingly
hostile and volatile political climate.</p>

<p>While human embryonic stem cells are just one of several types of
stem cells being studied for their innate, but complex, abilities to treat
diseases, Goldstein explained, they are an important weapon in a growing
arsenal. </p>

<p>It
takes a great deal of time, money, and patience to develop these therapies, he
noted.</p>

<p>?It
would be a shame to go back to the dark age solution that we had under the Bush
administration,? said Goldstein, who is currently focused largely on ALS, also
known as Lou Gehrig?s disease, named for the legendary New York Yankee.</p>

<p>Gehrig
died from the disease at age 37.</p>

<p>Goldstein said a lot of individuals and
institutions are working to find treatments for ALS, which has enjoyed a boost
in awareness and funding thanks to the recent ?Ice Bucket Challenge? that
caught on nationwide.</p>

<p>?It?s important that we develop an aggressive set
of cell therapy programs so that we have multiple ?shots on goal,?? Goldstein
said. ?We need to attack the disease from as many angles as possible.?</p>




<h2>Huntington?s disease mom longs for cure</h2>

<p>For the last 25 years, <a href="https://news.uci.edu/feature/a-cause-close-to-her-heart/" target="_blank">Frances
Saldana</a> has been on a mission to increase awareness of Huntington?s
disease (HD), a debilitating, incurable, and often inherited disease.</p>

<p>?It?s become my mission in life to advocate
for support of HD research and for excellence in patient care,? said Saldana, whose husband, Hector
Portillo, didn?t tell her he had the disease.</p>

<p>Three of their children inherited HD from
their father. Both of Saldana?s daughters have died, and her son is not doing well.</p>

<p>?My son Michael is fighting for his life
every single day, but time is running out for him too,? she said. ?The
suffering endured at the end of life for HD patients is unimaginable. My
daughter, Margie, and her husband did not have the money to go through IVF when
they started their family. They had two beautiful children. I live in fear that
my two grandchildren, now 19 and 21, are also at risk of inheriting HD.?</p>

<p>When Saldana learned that members of Congress were
urging President Trump to fire Collins, her heart sank.</p>

<p>?To have the door close on this research
because they have this belief would be tragic,? she said. ?In my opinion, an
embryonic egg is not life until it?s attached to the placenta.?</p>

<p>Saldana said that if she had the opportunity, she
would ask people who oppose this research, ?Have they ever seen their own
children dying devastating deaths? Have they ever seen their own children lose
the ability to talk, to swallow? Have they ever had their own child die in
their arms, and yet know that there is hope, that there is a chance with this
research to find a cure?? </p>

<p>?I?ve dedicated my life to supporting this
research, from Team Hope walks to bake sales, everything and anything to find a
cure,? she said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pioneering
HD researcher hoping for the best</h2>

<p>Leslie Thompson, PhD, a professor of
psychiatry and human behavior, and professor of neurobiology and behavior, at
the University of California Irvine, has devoted her entire career to unlocking
the mysteries of Huntington?s disease and finding treatments.</p>

<p>Thompson, who said many of her patients with
HD are like family, said human embryonic stem cells present great hope for finding
a treatment for HD.</p>

<p>And after decades of painstaking study, she
told Healthline that her work could lead to human clinical trials for people
with HD as soon as two or three years from now.</p>

<p>Thompson keeps a picture of Saldana?s children in her office to
remind her of what her research is really all about.</p>

<p>?I?m deeply concerned how this could move the
field backwards,? she said, but added that she is ?hopeful? her work and that
of others will be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>?We?re in an exciting, unprecedented time of
opportunity to use stem cells for treatments,? she said.</p>

<h2>Propositions
and solidarity</h2>

<p>When former President George W. Bush decided
to halt new human embryonic stem cell research, Saldana recalled, ?We all jumped and
went toward getting <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2004/71_11_2004.htm" target="_blank">Prop 71</a> passed.?</p>

<p>The California Stem Cell Research and Cures
Initiative, which was passed by a 60-40 margin, was drafted by the <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine</a>. It has provided millions of dollars in stem
cell research in the state, including embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<p>The public vote on this initiative has helped
California become the national leader in stem cell research. </p>

<p>There is also solidarity in the stem cell
community. Even scientists who don?t use human embryonic stem cells still
support their colleagues who do.</p>

<p>Jeanne Loring, PhD, a professor of developmental neurobiology, and
director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at the Scripps Research
Institute in La Jolla, Calif., made the shift about a decade ago from
human embryonic stem cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS), which she makes from cells
cultured from skin biopsies.</p>

<p>?There are certain advantages to IPS,? she
said, but added that she still fully supports embryonic stem cell research. </p>

<p>?It?s hard to predict what President Trump
will do,? said Loring, whose lab is working on finding treatments for
Parkinson?s disease, discovering the cause of autism, ways to treat it, and
more.</p>

<p>Loring notes that there are great
misunderstandings about embryonic stem cell research and where the cells come
from. </p>

<p>?There is always
an undercurrent of misunderstanding about sources of human stem cells. People
think they are associated with abortion but they are not.? she said. </p>




<h2>What?s
next for embryonic stem cell research?</h2>

<p>What lies ahead for human embryonic stem cell
research is anyone?s guess. </p>

<p>When Obama signed the order to lift Bush?s
ban on new embryonic stem cell research, he said, ?In
recent years, when it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering
discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between
sound science and moral values.?</p>

<p>?In this case, I
believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are
called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we
have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research ? and the
humanity and conscience to do so responsibly.?</p>

<p>Goldstein
said he hopes Trump, too, will embrace the importance of this research that
seeks to find treatments for deadly diseases.</p>

<p>?It?s
early in this administration, there is still time for them to staff up with
people who will give the President the appropriate scientific advice,?
Goldstein said. ?There are many challenges facing us that are technological in
nature. You can?t have a humming economy without robust investment in science.
It drives the development of new technologies and devices. An investment in
science pays far more than what you put in.?</p>

<p>Goldstein
said investing heavily in science has helped give the United States the quality
of life that Americans now enjoy.</p>

<p>?Our
investments in science and technology are likely the reason for winning World
War II,? he said. ?And our investment in biotech has revolutionized medicine
and has been invaluable to providing jobs in many states.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-14T14:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-14T14:00:00</updateddate><category>Technology</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-human-embryonic-stem-cell-research-in-jeopardy</guid><dc:date>2017-06-14T14:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Trump Disorders: How to Cope with a Chaotic Presidency</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/trump-disorders-how-to-cope-with-a-chaotic-presidency </link><description><![CDATA[<p>The
editor of Vanity Fair magazine has a simple explanation for what you might be
feeling.</p>

<p>In
his <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/graydon-carter-donald-trump-first-100-days" target="_blank">summer
2017 editor?s letter</a>,
Graydon Carter wrote that the United States is suffering from PTSD.</p>

<p>As
in ?President Trump Stress Disorder.?</p>

<p>The
stress and anxiety level of the country has reached such a high level that
Harvard University was compelled to publish an <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1702111" target="_blank">article</a> in the New England Journal of
Medicine earlier this month.</p>

<p>In
it, the authors said the reaction to the Trump presidency could be having deep
and long-lasting health effects on the nation.</p>

<p>Those
include higher disease risk, premature births, and earlier deaths.</p>

<p>?Elections can
matter for the health of children and adults in profound ways that are often
unrecognized and unaddressed,? David R. Williams, PhD, MPH, lead author of the
article, professor of public health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health, and professor of African and African-American studies at Harvard
University, said in a press release.</p>

<p>And
these so-called Trump Disorders aren?t just affecting those who dislike the
president.</p>

<p>Elaine
Ducharme, PhD, a board-certified clinical psychologist in Connecticut, told
Healthline that supporters of the president are feeling stressed over the
current investigations into the White House, as well as the constant criticism
of Trump by opponents.</p>

<p>?The
level of venom coming out of people?s mouths on both sides of the aisle is kind
of disturbing,? Ducharme said. ?It?s like a hotly contested divorce.?</p>


<h2>It?s more than just stress </h2>

<p>The
New England Journal of Medicine article was written by Williams and Dr. Morgan
Medlock, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital/McLean Hospital.</p>

<p>In
their posting, the authors quoted a number of studies that detailed the
potential effects of election results, in particular the 2016 contest.</p>

<p>One
is a <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/02/stressed-nation.aspx" target="_blank">survey</a> by the American Psychological
Association released in February, that revealed 57 percent of the country feels
the current political climate is a significant or somewhat significant source
of stress.</p>

<p>In
addition, two-thirds of respondents said they were concerned about the future
of the nation.</p>

<p>Williams
and Medlock said marginalized groups such as racial minorities are likely to be
affected most.</p>

<p>They
said that is because they are facing hostile environments in the wake of the
Trump presidency.</p>

<p>The
authors noted that after President Barack Obama was elected in 2008 one-third
of white Americans in one survey said they were ?troubled? that a black man was
in the White House.</p>

<p>They
said there was a ?marked increase? in racial animosity on social media after
that historic election.</p>

<p>The
authors added that Trump?s victory last November appears to be bringing ?to the
surface preexisting hostile attitudes toward racial and ethnic minorities,
immigrants, and Muslims.?</p>

<p>They
also quoted one survey of 2,000 elementary and high school teachers in which
half of the instructors said that since the 2016 presidential campaign began
many of their students have been ?emboldened? to use racial slurs and name
calling.</p>

<p>Stress
is one of the outcomes of this heated climate, but Williams and Medlock say it
goes beyond that.</p>

<p>They
referred to an August 2016 study of 1,836 U.S. counties, conducted by the
University of California at Berkeley. The results revealed an elevated risk of
heart disease among both black and white residents in what were termed as ?high
prejudice counties.?</p>

<p>They
also spotlighted a 2006 study by the University of Chicago. Researchers stated
that six months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks there was an increase in babies
with low birth-weights, as well as premature births among Arab-American women.
Researchers chalked that up to the hostility toward this group after the
attacks.</p>

<p>The
authors also warned that cuts to health and social service programs could
further exacerbate some of these health effects.</p>

<p>They
urged healthcare providers to better recognize some of these physical and
mental health issues. In addition, they said medical professionals should
create ?safe spots? for patients, as well as advocate for helpful policies and
programs.</p>



<h2>How
can you cope?</h2>

<p>Ducharme
said there are a number of things people can do to relieve stress they might be
feeling about the Trump presidency.</p>

<p>One
strategy is to simply take a break from it.</p>

<p>?Go
ahead and listen to the news, but then shut it off,? she said. ?There?s only so
much you can say hour after hour. Do something more pleasant instead.?</p>

<p>Ducharme
said doing something positive that is also physical is a great stress reliever.</p>

<p>Activities
such as taking a walk or doing yoga are alternatives.</p>

<p>She
even mentioned <a href="http://www.wreckingclub.com/" target="_blank">The
Wrecking Club</a>
in New York. That?s where you pay to use a sledgehammer to break apart old
furniture and other items before they?re carted off to the landfill.</p>

<p>Officials
at the club, which opened in February, told Healthline most of their customers
come in simply for fun or as part of a dating group or bachelor party.</p>

<p>They
did say a few people have paid to relieve their anger from a divorce or, yes,
the current political climate.</p>

<p>Ducharme
said doing relaxing things you enjoy is another stress buster. Watching a movie
or doing a crossword puzzle are good distractions.</p>

<p>She
also advises people to keep things in perspective.</p>

<p>Our
political system, she notes, has checks and balances.</p>

<p>?The
reality is we have a democracy and the president isn?t a dictator,? she said.</p>

<p>She
also tells people not to take dire predictions too seriously. After all, not
many experts predicted Donald Trump would win the presidency.</p>

<p>Most
of all, Ducharme says to stay informed but also adopt a ?wait and see?
attitude.</p>

<p>?Sometimes
we have to live with uncertainty. The reality is we don?t necessarily know
what?s going to happen,? she said.</p>

<p>She
recommends people look for the positive.</p>

<p>?Try
looking at what?s stable instead of what?s unstable,? she said.</p>

<p>She
says you can?t control what is happening in Washington, but you can control how
you behave.</p>

<p>Speak
respectfully to others, get involved in a positive local effort, or assist
others.</p>

<p>?It
helps for people to hear and see things that are reassuring,? she said.</p>

urge to have a baby kicked into high gear. She?d been married to her husband
for about three years, and it was as if a switch flipped on.</p>

<p>?At 32 it was ?game on,?? she said. ?There
was this rage to have a baby.?</p>

<p>Thurston said she was a force to be reckoned
with ? taking her temperature, charting her cycle ? She did this for a year.
But when the couple didn?t get pregnant they sought help from a fertility
clinic.</p>

<p>Thurston was diagnosed with what she
described as ?old eggs.? Meaning they required more hormones than she produced in
order to drop from the ovaries. Thurston was told she had a 10 percent chance of
getting pregnant.</p>

<p>After much consideration, the couple decided
to use <a href="/health/in-vitro-fertilization-ivf">in vitro fertilization (IVF)</a> and
a donor egg. Nine months later, Thurston gave birth to a healthy baby. </p>

<p>But just seven weeks later, something
remarkable happened. Thurston became pregnant on her own.</p>

<p>?I was elated and horrified,? she said with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>To have a child via IVF and then get pregnant
naturally is not as uncommon as people may think.</p>

<p>One <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-after-ivf-pregnant-idUSBRE84212L20120503" target="_blank">report</a> out of France was based on surveys from 2,000 couples. The
findings showed that roughly 17 percent who had a child because of IVF also
eventually ended up conceiving naturally. </p>



<h2>Debunking the ?new baby fertility? myth</h2>

<p>So what causes a woman, who?s been diagnosed
with fertility issues, to suddenly get pregnant on her own? </p>

<p>One theory floating around is that women who
are around babies somehow experience improved fertility. </p>

<p>The fertility experts that Healthline spoke
to said a successful pregnancy involves many factors. But the notion that being
around babies is enough to help a woman with known fertility issues become pregnant isn?t a theory they
prescribe to.</p>

<p>?There is
zero evidence of this, other than anecdotes,? Dr. Paula Amato, Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of
Medicine associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, told Healthline.</p>

<p>A successful pregnancy in the face of
infertility is no small feat, she added. Infertility is caused by a number of
different issues, and to get at the root cause a couple must endure a battery
of tests. </p>

<p>This includes looking at sperm count and
analyzing hormone levels, among other procedures, before any diagnosis can be
made.</p>

<p>Once the barriers to pregnancy are defined, methods
are introduced to encourage implantation of an egg. After the treatments are in
place, a lot comes down to a mix of science and luck.</p>

<p>?It?s really a numbers game for the most
part,? she said. </p>

<p>Having said that, Amato noted that having a
successful pregnancy ? with or without medical intervention ? is always an encouraging
mark for future pregnancies.</p>

<p>?Having a child in the past is a good
prognostic sign,? she said.</p>

<p>Couples trying to conceive naturally, but
haven?t had success, can choose from a lengthy list of fertility treatments.
These include artificial insemination, surrogacy, fertility medication, and
donor eggs. </p>

<p>IVF is one of the most popular procedures.
According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2014-report/art-2014-national-summary-report.pdf#page=55" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, in 2014 more than 70,000 babies were born with the help of <a href="https://news.uthscsa.edu/five-misconceptions-fertility-treatment/" target="_blank">fertility treatments</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Eric Surrey is the chief medical officer
at the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine, one of the top fertility
clinics in the United States, according to <a href="http://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/infertility/treatments/best-fertility-centers/" target="_blank">Parents</a> magazine. He said it?s not impossible that a couple who conceived
via IVF can get pregnant again without such treatment. </p>

<p>However, he agreed with Amato that there
isn?t evidence to support the theory that being around babies can help.</p>

<p>Rather, Surrey noted, a lot depends on the
root cause of the infertility, and more importantly, the age of the mother.</p>

<p>?If you take away everything, the single
greatest predictor [of pregnancy] is female age,? he told Healthline.</p>

<p>Surrey said as a general rule, couples that
are experiencing infertility shouldn?t wait too long to seek treatment. That?s
because infertility doesn?t follow the same path for all people. What may work
for one couple may not produce the same outcome for another.</p>

<p>?There is rarely a single problem,? he said.
?Everyone is different.?</p>

<p>Thurston?s scenario is a perfect example. </p>

<p>Amato noted that getting pregnant less than two
months after giving birth is very rare. But in her own practice she has seen
patients who conceived naturally after IVF.</p>

<p>?It happens, but it?s not happening in the
majority of the cases,? she said.</p>

<p>For Thurston, she believes that the IVF
treatment somehow affected her ability to conceive naturally. </p>

<p>?All of that stimulation in my system just
amped things up,? she said. ?It did something.?</p>

<p>Thurston may be right. That second pregnancy
turned out to be twins.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-14T10:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-14T10:00:00</updateddate><category>Women's Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-being-around-a-baby-boost-fertility</guid><dc:date>2017-06-14T10:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Patients May Face Big Bill Markup in ER, Study Finds</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/patients-may-face-big-bill-markup </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Is your
hospital charging fair prices for services?</p>

<p>According to
a recent study published in <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2629494" target="_blank">JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, the cost of emergency medical care varies widely from one
hospital to another in the United States ? and many charge exorbitant markups.</p>

<p>The research
team that published the study analyzed billing records for 12,337 emergency
medicine doctors from 2,707 hospitals across all 50 states in 2013. </p>

<p>Additionally,
they found that emergency departments charged an average markup of 340 percent
on Medicare allowable amounts.</p>

<p>The Medicare
allowable amount is the sum of what Medicare reimburses for a service, the
deductible and coinsurance paid by beneficiaries, and any amount that a third
party is responsible for covering.</p>

<p>Some people
think that Medicare allowable amounts are set too low.</p>

<p>But Dr.
Martin Makary, MPH, the study?s senior investigator and a professor of surgery
at <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/05/30/hospital-markups-340-percent-over-medicare/" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a> suggested they reflect the true costs of providing care.</p>

<p>?The reality
is, the vast majority of medical centers do accept Medicare patients, which
tells us they likely find those patients profitable to them,? he told Healthline.
</p>

<p>?Therefore,
what Medicare is paying them is probably somewhere close to the actual cost of
delivering that service. It?s either similar or higher than the true cost to
the hospital.?</p>

<p>His research
team found that hospitals in neighborhoods with higher proportions of
uninsured, African-American, and Hispanic patients tended to charge higher markups.</p>

<p>While they
don?t know why that?s the case, Makary is concerned about how it may impact
community members and contribute to healthcare disparities.</p>

<p>?This
problem is a real problem,? he said. ?And it?s crushing everyday Americans.?</p>



<h2>Difficult to shop
around</h2>

<p>When the
researchers calculated each bill?s markup ratio, they found wide variability
between hospitals. </p>

<p>The emergency
departments studied charged anywhere from 1.0 to 12.6 times the Medicare
allowable amount for services. </p>

<p>For a
procedure with a Medicare allowable amount of $100, that translates to a price
range of $100 to $1,260.</p>

<p>They also
found that emergency departments tended to charge more than internal medicine
departments for the same procedures, even within the same hospital.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aha.org/" target="_blank">American Hospital Association
(AHA)</a> noted differences in patient needs across
communities as an explanation
for price variances in a statement sent to
Healthline. </p>

<p>?Hospital payments will vary because they
reflect each individual hospital and the unique care needs of the patient
population it serves,? the AHA noted. ?For example, one community may have
sicker patients with more chronic illness while another may care for more
uninsured patients.?</p>

<p>While Makary
acknowledged that some variations in pricing may be justified, he also believes
that predatory pricing practices are a problem.</p>

<p>?When you go
to a hospital bleeding, holding the wound as you walk into the emergency room,
you?re often asked to sign a form that says you legally agree to pay for a bill
that you not only haven?t seen but can?t get an estimate on if you ask,? Makary
said.</p>

<p>?In my
opinion, these represent predatory pricing practices. They?re unfair contracts
pushed on people at a time when they?re most vulnerable, with markups that can
be at times egregious,? he added.</p>

<p>When
patients don?t know what they will be charged ahead of time, it?s difficult or
impossible for them to shop around. This is especially true for patients in the
middle of a medical emergency.</p>



<h2>More protections
needed</h2>

<p>In some
cases, hospitals waive fees or negotiate charges down. </p>

<p>But in other
cases, patients are stuck with the full bill. </p>

<p>Those who
lack insurance or access out-of-network care are particularly vulnerable.</p>

<p>?When you go
out of network, you can sometimes be responsible for the entire bill,? Makary
told Healthline. Additionally, he said if a patient doesn?t have
insurance or their insurance only pays a small part of the bill, your bill
could be sent to collections.</p>

<p>He argued
that fairer and more transparent pricing practices are needed.</p>

<p>?Well first
of all, we need to ask hospitals to do a better job providing estimates when
estimates are requested,? he said. ?A hospital and a doctor cannot predict a
complicated course of care. But they can answer the question, ?if I end up
having this straightforward procedure or service done, how much would it
cost???</p>

<p>?And we
probably need a kinder system that simply asks, is it worthwhile to get
something done?? he added. ?And if so, can we help you get the procedure done??</p>

<p>The AHA
stresses that some hospitals are working to address these issues. </p>

<p>?Hospitals
recognize that the billing system is complex and are both working to make bills
more patient-friendly, as well as demonstrating a significant commitment to
making care more affordable,? AHA officials told Healthline in a statement. ?We
are working with a broad spectrum of industry stakeholders to provide guidance
and tools for more meaningful and transparent price information and pledge to
work with patients, engage them to answer questions about bills, provide
financial counselling, and develop a billing process that is clear, concise,
and correct.?</p>

<p>Some states including
<a href="http://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/surprise-medical-bills/" target="_blank">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/health-insurance/states-work-to-limit-out-of-network-medical-bills/" target="_blank">Florida</a> have also passed laws to help
safeguard patients from inflated out-of-network hospital bills. </p>

<p>To protect
patients across the country, Makary believes a national approach is needed.</p>

innovative treatment could change how we treat <a href="/health/multiple-sclerosis">multiple sclerosis (MS)</a>, but are we any closer to a
cure?</p>

<p>The
work of Dr. Su Metcalfe, founder and chief scientific officer of the biotech
company LIFNano, appears to be breathing new life into that hope.</p>

<p>Metcalfe
and her team developed a way to fight MS by using the body?s own natural
mechanisms ? but it hasn?t been tested in humans yet.</p>

<p>MS
is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease that can result in
an array of neurological symptoms including fatigue, muscle spasms, speech
problems, and numbness. It is caused by the immune system attacking myelin, the
insulating coating that runs along the outside of nerve cells. The result is
damage to the brain and central nervous system.</p>

<p>The
disease currently affects roughly 2.5 million people worldwide. About 200 new
cases are <a href="/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic">diagnosed each week</a>
in the United States.</p>

<h2>Flipping the switch on the
immune system</h2>

<p>LIFNano
uses a new treatment based on LIF ? a stem cell protein that forms naturally in
the body ? to signal and regulate the immune system?s response to myelin.</p>

<p>?LIF,
in addition to regulating and protecting us against attack, also plays a major
role in keeping the brain and spinal cord healthy,? Metcalfe recently told <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/business/technology/meet-cambridge-scientist-verge-curing-13129687" target="_blank">Cambridge News</a>. </p>

<p>?In
fact it plays a major role in tissue repair generally, turning on stem cells
that are naturally occurring in the body, making it a natural regenerative
medicine, but also plays a big part in repairing the brain when it?s been
damaged,? she said.</p>

<p>Metcalfe
has spent years studying LIF, but only recently realized its potential for
treatment ? likening it to an on/off switch for the immune system.</p>

<p>However,
once she discovered its potential, there were almost immediate problems in its
application. One of the earliest was how quickly LIF breaks down once it is
administered into the body.</p>

<p>?If
you try just to inject it into a patient, it dissipates or disappears in about 20
minutes,? Olivier Jarry, CEO of LIFNano, told Healthline. </p>

<p>?That
makes it unusable in a clinic. You would have to have some kind of pump and
inject it continually.?</p>

<h2>A novel delivery system</h2>

<p>A breakthrough
came for Metcalfe when she took findings from her studies of LIF and applied
them to nanotechnology. The treatment she is now developing relies on
nanospheres derived from a well-established medical polymer known as PLGA,
which is already used in materials like stitches. And because it is
biodegradable, it can be left to dissolve inside the body. </p>

<p>Storing
LIF inside these PLGA nanospheres before administering them into the
bloodstream allows for a sustained dose over the course of several days.</p>

<p>The
process differs significantly from the current drugs used to treat MS. These
treatments most often fall under the category of drugs known as
immunosuppressors, which inhibit the body?s overall immune system response.</p>

<p>LIF
is theoretically much more precise than immunosuppressors, and should keep the
immune system functioning against harmful infections and disease.</p>

<p>?We?re
not using any drugs,? said Metcalfe. ?We?re simply switching on the body?s own
systems of self-tolerance and repair. There aren?t any side effects because all
we?re doing is tipping the balance. Autoimmunity happens when that balance has
gone awry slightly, and we simply reset that.?</p>

<h2>Tempering expectations for
a ?cure?</h2>

<p>The
team cautions that LIF therapy is still several years away.</p>

<p>While
some outlets have run wild with Metcalfe?s research, announcing that a ?cure?
for MS is right around the corner, those headlines are speculative.</p>

<p>Some
MS advocacy groups have even made public statements calling coverage of her
work ?<a href="https://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/news-about-ms/talk-a-cure-premature" target="_blank">premature and irresponsible</a>.?</p>

<p>Jarry
told Healthline that LIFNano is expecting to enter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143534.htm" target="_blank">phase I trials</a>
in 2020. This
would be the first time that it is used in human subjects. But even if the
treatment proves to be safe and effective, the soonest it could be on the
market is 2023, he estimated.</p>

<p>The main
focus of LIF therapy is now on MS. But it has potential for treating other
autoimmune diseases including psoriasis and lupus.</p>

<p>?We
are optimistic in the sense that we may provide a long-term remission for
patients with MS,? said Jarry.</p>

<p>?Is
it a cure? We?d love at some point to use the term ?cure,? but we are very cautious.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-13T13:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-13T13:00:00</updateddate><category>Multiple Sclerosis</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/stem-cell-therapy-hope-for-ms-remission</guid><dc:date>2017-06-13T13:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Science Says Get Moving to Avoid Increased Risk of Certain Cancers</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/get-moving-to-avoid-cancers </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Cancer.</p>

<p>The
word alone can ignite a primitive fear living inside us. It is
estimated that in 2017 alone, <a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2017.html" target="_blank">1.7 million
new cases</a> of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States. But increasingly,
scientists have found that people can take action to reduce their risk of getting
that diagnosis. </p>

<p>In a
recent study, researchers at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), in
Buffalo, N.Y., investigated whether there is a link between living a mostly
sedentary lifestyle and being diagnosed with certain cancers later in life.</p>

<p>Researchers
studied a total of 368 people who were diagnosed with <a href="/health/renal-cell-carcinoma">renal</a> (kidney) or <a href="/health/bladder-cancer">bladder cancer</a>. The subjects? lifetime recreational
physical inactivity levels were compared with those of a 766-person cancer-free
control group. </p>

<p>All
the people had received medical care at RPCI. </p>

<p>Those
considered physically inactive reported at least 20 years of no regular
physical activity immediately prior to enrolling in the study.</p>

<h2>?It?s never too late? </h2>

<p>The
study <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877782117300632" target="_blank">published</a> in the Cancer Epidemiology
medical journal suggests a significant association between living a life with
little to no recreational physical activity and an increased risk for bladder
and renal cancers. </p>

<p>The
researchers found that the risk association was so strong it held even in study
subjects who were obese. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.roswellpark.edu/kirsten-moysich" target="_blank">Kirsten
Moysich, PhD, MS</a>, one of the study?s authors and a Distinguished Professor of
Oncology in the Departments of Cancer Prevention and Immunology at RPCI,
explained to Healthline how this study bolsters advice to be active. </p>

<p>?The
main takeaway from our research is that we can add reduced risk of many cancers
to the long list of health benefits from staying active,? Moysich said. ?Other
studies suggest that starting at younger ages is a good way to make fitness
part of your lifestyle and a lifelong habit, but it's never too late to start.?</p>


<p>Currently,
<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/bladder-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank">bladder</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank">kidney</a> cancers account for approximately
8.5 percent of all new cancers, or approximately 143,000 new
cancer diagnoses annually, according to the
American Cancer Society. </p>

<p>Taking
steps to make sure you don?t have an increased cancer risk doesn?t mean you
have to start training for a marathon. </p>

<p>?It?s
important to do some exercise or engage in moderate physical activity
regularly, and there are all kinds of ways to work that into your life,?
Moysich said. </p>

<p>To be
clear, the authors were studying the risks associated with being inactive over
a long period of time. They have evidence that being inactive is associated
with increased cancer risk for renal and bladder cancers. However, it?s not
definitive if being active provides any sort of protective benefit against
developing cancer. </p>

<h2>Women have additional
reason to exercise</h2>

<p>Other <a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/media/news/lack-exercise-associated-ovarian-cancer-risk-and-survival-how-much-exercise-enough" target="_blank">studies</a> by researchers at RPCI
suggest that in addition to bladder and renal cancers, lack of exercise may
increase the risk for other cancers specific to women.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/media/news/lack-exercise-associated-ovarian-cancer-risk-and-survival-how-much-exercise-enough" target="_blank">Two of these
studies</a> deal with <a href="/health/cancer/ovarian-cancer-early-signs">ovarian</a> cancer. The studies concluded that years of physical inactivity prior to
diagnosis was associated with developing and dying from the disease.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/media/news/exercise-may-reduce-risk-cervical-cancer" target="_blank">Another study</a> found that even minimal exercise, such as walking 30 minutes per week,
can drastically reduce a woman?s risk of developing <a href="/health/cervical-cancer">cervical</a> cancer.<br><br>While <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html" target="_blank">ovarian cancer</a> represents 1.3 percent
of all new cancer diagnoses, <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html" target="_blank">cervical cancer</a> causes 0.7 percent of all
cancer deaths. The
five-year survival rate for women with cervical cancer is 67.1 percent ? about
the same as for bladder and renal cancers. The ovarian cancer survival rate is
a much lower 46.5 percent.</p>

<h2>Take control of risk</h2>

<p>These recent studies show there are <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/be-active/importance-of-physical-activity/" target="_blank">actions we can take</a> to keep
our risk levels from increasing. Exercising regularly is also a way to help
limit our risk of being diagnosed with other conditions, including:</p>

<ul><li><a href="/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension">high blood
pressure</a></li><li><a href="/health/high-cholesterol/lipid-disorder">high blood
cholesterol</a></li><li><a href="/health/stroke-types">stroke</a></li><li><a href="/health/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a></li><li><a href="/health/heart-disease">heart disease</a></li><li><a href="/health/cancer/cancer-ribbon-colors">cancer</a></li></ul>

<h2>Drop and give me 20</h2>

<p>Despite
the large body of evidence showing the positive effects of exercise, why is it
so hard for people to stick with their exercise routines? </p>

<p>Healthline
posed that question to <a href="http://www.trainwithmeghan.com/" target="_blank">Meghan Kennihan</a>, a National Academy of Sports Medicine personal
trainer and RRCA/USATF run coach outside of Chicago, Ill. Kennihan offered the
following helpful suggestions to Healthline readers just starting out on their
journeys to achieving physical fitness.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Don't be too hard on yourself</strong>. Nobody?s perfect. Allow
yourself to have realistic expectations.</li><li><strong>Skip the ?all or nothing? mindset</strong>. Doing something is better than
doing nothing. Starting is EVERYTHING.</li><li><strong>Create a habit. </strong>Personal fitness should become a

<h2>Aye aye, Captain!</h2>

<p>For
better or worse, when it comes to our health, we?re each the captain of our own
ship. We need to move in order to shake off the dust. Doing nothing sets the
stage for infiltration by a host of physical ailments and diseases.</p>

<p>Researchers
are showing how a lifetime of physical inactivity can increase our risk of
certain cancers. And we now understand that we have the ability to keep our
risk of diseases from climbing. </p>

<p>Make
yourself a promise to put yourself in charge of your health ? no matter if you
start with a 5-mile run or a short, enjoyable walk around the block.</p>

<p>And
remember, talk with your doctor before starting any new physical fitness
routine.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-13T11:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-13T11:00:00</updateddate><category>Cancer,Fitness and Exercise</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/get-moving-to-avoid-cancers</guid><dc:date>2017-06-13T11:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Will a New Drug to Fight Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Really Work?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/new-drug-to-fight-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Scientists hope a new discovery will
give a boost to <a href="/drugs/vancomycin/oral-capsule">vancomycin</a>, a
?last resort? antibiotic that?s effectiveness has been weakened by bacteria
resistant to its actions.</p>

<p>First introduced in 1958, vancomycin is
used to treat infections when other antibiotics fail. However, starting in the
late 1980s, vancomycin-resistant bacteria emerged, leading scientists to
engineer more powerful versions of the drug.</p>

<p>Now, researchers have developed a new
version of vancomycin that may prove to be even more successful than previous versions.</p>

<p>The upgraded compound attacks bacteria
in three different ways, which have proven to be thousands of times more
powerful than the original version, according to lab test results. </p>



<h2>Long quest for improved vancomycin</h2>

<p>Vancomycin kills by preventing bacteria from
building cell walls. It does this by binding to cell wall precursors, which contain
two copies of the amino acid D-alanine.</p>

<p>Bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin
have replaced one D-alanine with another amino acid, D-lactic acid. This change
from the double D-alanine reduces vancomycin?s ability to bind to its target by
1,000 fold. As a result, it?s less effective at killing bacteria. </p>

<p>Bacterial infections can be deadly. More than
23,000 people die each year from infections caused by organisms resistant to
antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf" target="_blank">Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). </p>

<p>Around 1,300 of these deaths are due to
vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> ? bacteria that have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html" target="_blank">labeled</a> a ?serious threat? by the CDC. </p>

<p>Vancomycin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>
(VRSA) ? which causes staph infections ? also exists, but is less common.</p>

<p>In 2011, researchers at The Scripps Research
Institute in La Jolla, Calif., <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja207142h" target="_blank">redesigned
vancomycin</a> so that it could bind to the
cell wall precursor that contains both D-alanine and D-lactic acid, a so-called
?pocket? modification.</p>

<p>?Many view this as important, beautiful work
because it involves a change to a single atom in vancomycin to counter a single
atom change in the bacterial cell wall precursor,? study author Dale Boger,
PhD, co-chair of The Scripps Research Institute?s Department of Chemistry, told
Healthline.</p>

<p>But there?s more to the story. Not only did
the redesigned vancomycin bind to bacteria that had one D-alanine and one
D-lactic acid. It was also able to bind to the bacteria with the double
D-alanine in their cell wall precursors. </p>

<p>So this new version of vancomycin was
effective against both resistant and nonresistant bacteria.</p>

<p>However, the researchers didn?t stop there. </p>



<p>Three-mode antibiotic more potent<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In a new study published May 23 in the
journal <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1704125114" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, Boger and his colleagues describe how they ?set out to improve?
vancomycin even further.</p>

<p>Adding on to their 2011 modification, they
added two new mechanisms of action to ?pocket-modified? vancomycin in an effort
to further undermine resistant bacteria. </p>

<p>One peripheral modification blocks bacteria
from synthesizing cell walls. The other causes the bacterial membrane to leak,
which leads to cell death.</p>

<p>This approach greatly enhanced vancomycin?s
antimicrobial abilities.</p>

<p>?The peripheral modifications improve potency
activity ? and in the end durability ? not by enhancing primary target binding,
but by acting by independent mechanisms of action,? said Boger.</p>

<p>Researchers tested the compound in the lab.
It was 25,000 to 50,000 times more potent than the original form of vancomycin
against vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em>. </p>

<p>It was also 250 to 500 times more potent than
the type of vancomycin currently used in clinics.</p>

<p>In addition, when researchers tested
vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> against the three-part compound, the
bacteria were unable to develop resistance even after 50 rounds. </p>

<p>Many antibiotics fail after a few rounds.</p>

<p>This may mean that the compound will be more
durable ? lasting a long time before the bacteria fight back and become
resistant to the medication. </p>

<p>?An antibiotic to which bacteria cannot
develop resistance is the Holy Grail,? David Weiss, PhD, associate professor of
medicine, and director of the Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center at Emory
University, told Healthline. </p>

<p>?It seems unlikely this is possible,? he
added, ?but we can certainly develop antibiotics to which resistance is much
less likely to occur, and the present study does a beautiful job of that.?</p>

<p>Weiss was not involved in the latest study.</p>

<p>Boger thinks the new compound would be
durable because if bacteria succeeded in overcoming one of the antibiotic?s
mechanisms of action, they would still be killed by the other two. In order to
develop resistance, bacteria would need to overcome all three mechanisms of
action at the same time ? an unlikely, but not impossible, scenario.</p>

<p>?Bacteria have so many different ways to
resist antibiotics, it seems impossible that resistance will not eventually
develop,? said Weiss. ?For example, even if the [bacterial] cells cannot
withstand the action of the modified vancomycin, they could find a way to
sequester it or degrade it and thus preemptively avoid its activity.?</p>

<p>The new compound still has a long way to go
before it can be used in the clinic, including animal tests and human clinical
trials. Only then will scientists know if it is safe and effective.</p>

<p>?It will be important to test this new
modified antibiotic in the setting of an infection in the future,? said Weiss.
And he added that not everything that works in the lab ends up working in real-life
situations.</p>

<p>Boger said he also hopes to simplify
production of the compound ? currently it takes 30 steps. This would make it
cheaper and more useful as another line of defense against dangerous
infections.</p>

<p>Weiss said that most approvals for new
antibiotics over the past few decades have been for ?derivatives of existing
classes,? like the work done by Boger?s group.</p>

<p>But it?s not the only method of protecting
people from infections.</p>

<p>?There is now an increased focus on
identifying new classes [of antibiotics],? said Weiss. ?Given the crisis that
we face, all approaches are necessary and welcome.?</p>

<p>Even if the new vancomycin succeeds in the
clinic, scientists probably won?t be able to rest anytime soon, especially when
working against the adaptability of the microscopic world.</p>

<p>?Scientists are, and will always be, trying
to stay one step ahead of bacterial evolution,? said Weiss.</p>

Could Revolutionize Care</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/new-drugs-targeting-cancer-biomarkers </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Laura
Dixon has a long history with cancer.</p>

<p>She
was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, pancreatic cancer in 2013, and ovarian
and endometrial cancer in 2014. Her treatment included several surgeries and a
variety of chemotherapy drugs.</p>

<p>In
2015, a tumor in her liver turned out to be a pancreatic cancer recurrence. </p>

<p>But
things were different this time.</p>

<p>The
49-year-old resident of Columbus, Ohio, had access to a clinical trial and a
previously approved cancer drug called Keytruda. The clinical trial took place
at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>?I
spoke with several doctors at several facilities,? Dixon told Healthline.
?Everyone said it was my best shot. I think because they knew it was a genetic
problem called Lynch syndrome, a genetic mutation that runs in the family. I
didn?t hesitate. The side effects didn?t sound too terrible and I haven?t had
many bad reactions, nothing to majorly change my life.?</p>

<p>But
her life did change.</p>

<p>She
received a 30-minute infusion of Keytruda every two or three weeks, for a total
of 17 treatments. </p>

<p>A CT
scan after 12 weeks showed the tumor had shrunk to half its original size. By
the 20-week mark, it was down to a tiny ?fleck.? Even that fleck was gone by
the 45-week mark. She had her last infusion in April 2016.</p>

<p>?Now
I go every three months for scans. I just had one and everything is still
perfect,? Dixon said. </p>



<h2>What makes Keytruda a game changer</h2>

<p>Keytruda,
a type of immune therapy, was previously approved for treatment of specific
cancers. These included metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung
cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical
Hodgkin?s lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma.</p>

<p>When
former president Jimmy Carter developed brain tumors due to metastatic
melanoma, Keytruda got the credit for shrinking them.</p>

<p>Now
there?s a new use for the drug.</p>

<p>In
May 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Keytruda to
treat any solid tumor with a specific genetic feature rather than the location
of the original tumor. It was a first.</p>

<p>The
new approval is for treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that
have a specific biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or
mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). </p>

<p>Dixon?s
tumor had the biomarker.</p>

<p>This
type of tumor is most likely to be found in colorectal, endometrial, and
gastrointestinal cancer. About 5 percent of people with metastatic colorectal
cancer have one of these biomarkers.</p>

<p>It
can also be found in other cancers, including breast, prostate, bladder, and
thyroid.</p>

<p>It?s
intended for people who are experiencing disease progression even after
receiving first-line therapies. </p>

<p>The
drug was studied in five uncontrolled, single-arm clinical trials. Of the 149
patients who received Keytruda in the trials, 39.6 percent had a complete or
partial response. For 78 percent of those patients, the response lasted for six
months or more. Further studies are underway.</p>



<h2>How Keytruda may impact
future treatment</h2>

<p><a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/john-l-hays" target="_blank">Dr.
John Hays</a> is
a cancer specialist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center where
Dixon received treatment. </p>

<p>He
told Healthline the new approval for Keytruda is an important precedent going
forward ? that this kind of therapy can be used for certain types of cancer
independent of origin. </p>

<p>He
cautioned that this is not a first-line treatment, at least not yet. </p>

<p>?If
you take colon cancer and patients that have MSI-H tumors, the upfront therapy
is chemotherapy. The standard of care isn?t to give immune therapy.? </p>

<p>For
now, the new use of Keytruda is intended for people who have progressed despite
other types of treatment.</p>

<p>How
many people might benefit? Hays said it?s hard to give exact numbers.</p>

<p>?While
it may help only a few patients with one type of cancer, it may help thousands
with other types of cancer. We?ve spent many years treating cancer based on
origin. We?ve come a long way and we don?t want to throw all that info out, but
this is a big step in a different direction,? Hays said. </p>

<p>?People
think this is the way going forward, but we shouldn?t stop what we?ve learned
about specific cancers in the past. Immune therapy was in its infancy 10 to 15
years ago and has really come full force in the last five years. In some cases,
it?s spectacular, as in MSI-H tumors and Lynch tumors. But in some cases, it
doesn?t work that well. It?s not the Holy Grail.?</p>

<p>Hays
explained that Keytruda may cause side effects. </p>

<p>?I
wish I had a drug with great efficacy and zero side effects. What we tend to
see with Keytruda is that most people have mild side effects and it?s generally
better tolerated than chemo. But some patients have very severe, even
life-threatening side effects.?</p>

<p>It?s
also expensive, costing about <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-drug-keytruda-keeps-some-patients-alive-3-years-n576376" target="_blank">$12,500
per month</a>.</p>

<p>Hays
said that most insurers are covering it for approved cancers. He suspects the
new approval will likely be covered as well.</p>

<h2>The regulatory path forward</h2>

<p>This
new use for Keytruda was possible because of the FDA?s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm" target="_blank">Accelerated
Approval</a>
regulations. The FDA can speed up the approval process when there?s an unmet
need for a serious condition. </p>

<p>Instead
of waiting to determine if a drug extends survival time, it can be approved
based on evidence that it shrinks tumors. Further trials are required to
confirm. In the meantime, Accelerated Approval can get new treatment to
patients whose options are limited.</p>

<p>Dr.
Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer of the <a href="http://www.lls.org/" target="_blank">Leukemia
&amp; Lymphoma Society
(LLS)</a>, told
Healthline she?s encouraged by this approval. </p>

<p>?This
approval, based primarily on patients with colon cancer, was exciting,? she
said. ?Not because of large patient numbers, but the idea that regulators have
opened their minds and are supportive of this. Prior to this, we often didn?t
see a path forward to get certain drugs approved. This is really a radical
change. The fact that the FDA is looking at how to do this is a whole new world
for agents drug companies would have thrown out otherwise.?</p>

<p>So,
is this type of approval the future of cancer treatment? Nichols believes it
is.</p>

<p>?If
we can find out how tumor biology directs tumor cells to become cancerous, we
can focus on that biology instead of having general treatments for breast
cancer or colon cancer.?</p>

<p>Nichols
said there are obstacles to bringing a new drug to market. </p>

<p>?What?s
tricky from a drug development point of view is that companies developing drugs
are always looking for a percentage of all colon cancer patients, for example,
to respond to a drug. So we?ve lost some interesting potential drugs because
they only worked in a small percentage of patients.?</p>

<p>Drug
companies can?t show a survival benefit if they treat many patients, but only a
small percentage respond.</p>

<p>?If
we can use biomarkers to help us say this is the group of patients where this
will work and improve survival rates, and these are the patients who don?t need
treatment with this agent, we can be much more focused about the population we
test and treat,? explained Nichols.</p>

<p>Other
similar treatments are currently in the works.</p>

<p>The
LLS has a precision medicine research program called Beat AML. </p>

<p>?We?re
testing the genetics of AML patients during the initial presentation of
disease,? explained Nichols. </p>

<p>?Then
we?re giving them a drug, or combination of drugs, that address the mutation we
find in leukemia cells. We want to see if we can be more precise in treatment
based on what we find in a biomarker test, rather than treating all patients
with AML the same way. This type of precision medicine is the wave of the
future.?</p>

<p>Dixon
is grateful for the clinical trial and for Keytruda. </p>

<p>She
advises others who have a tough diagnosis to explore clinical trials and ask a
lot of questions.</p>

<p>?The research being done is revolutionary. They?re
finding new things every day for genetic problems rather than the kind of
cancer you have. Don?t give up because of a bad diagnosis,? said Dixon.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-12T16:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-12T16:00:00</updateddate><category>Cancer</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/new-drugs-targeting-cancer-biomarkers</guid><dc:date>2017-06-12T16:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Are Rare Cancers on the Rise?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-rare-cancers-on-the-rise </link><description><![CDATA[<p>Cancer
remains a major health obstacle across the globe, but now it looks like rare
forms of cancer are becoming more common.</p>

<p>According
to a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21400/full" target="_blank">study</a> published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 1 in 5 cancers diagnosed in
America is considered a rare cancer. Rare cancers are those with less than six
cases per year per 100,000 Americans.</p>

<p>Carol
E. DeSantis, MPH, the director of breast and gynecological cancer surveillance
for the American Cancer Society, conducted the research using data from the
North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. She looked at more than 100 types
of rare cancers.</p>

<p>Rare
cancer rates were higher in Hispanics, Asians, and Pacific Islanders compared with
non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites. Also, 71 percent of cancers in
children and adolescents were rare, while less than 20 percent of cancers in
Americans 65 years of age and up were rare.</p>

<p>Does
this mean that rare cancers are on the rise? Not quite, according to <a href="http://www.cancercenter.com/press-center/leadership/maurie-markman/" target="_blank">Dr. Maurie Markman</a>, president of medicine and
science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America.</p>

<p>Now
that we can see cancers at the molecular level, we are able to better identify
them ? and that?s why you see rarer cancers being diagnosed.</p>

<p>?The
diagnosis of cancer is still a histological one,? Markman told Healthline.
Doctors can better pinpoint different types of cancer and subsets due to all
the breakthroughs. This is why doctors can better predict how patients will
respond to different treatments.</p>

<p>?Cancers
are increasingly being subdivided into groups of cancers based on molecular profiling.
The more precise definition of cancers will result in more people being
diagnosed with a rare cancer,? DeSantis told Healthline.</p>

<p>DeSantis
explained that rare cancers are inherently more difficult to study as there are
fewer patients and less research money to fund these studies. However, progress
is being made to overcome some of these challenges through collaboration and
novel study designs.</p>

<p>?I
think the proliferation of rare cancers is actually an indication that we are
getting ahead of cancer, as it reflects our increasing knowledge and
understanding of cancer,? DeSantis added. ?The more precisely we can define a
cancer, the better we will be able to target and treat that cancer.?</p>

<h2>Targeted treatments bring hope</h2>

<p>While
there may not be as much research done on rare cancers as types that are more
widely known, new drugs are hitting the market to target rare cancers ? something
that Markman finds encouraging. When a rare cancer drug gets approval from the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), insurers are more likely to cover it, which is a
boon for people with these uncommon diseases. </p>

<p>?The increase in the proportion of rare cancers calls for more funds in research in these
diseases, which may not have benefitted from advances as much as more common cancers,? Dr. Paolo Boffetta, MPH,
the associate director for cancer prevention at the Tisch Cancer Institute at
Mount Sinai in New York, told Healthline.</p>

<h2>Rare, but
still risky</h2>

<p>When talking about rare cancers, it?s important to remember
that the type of cancer may not be common, but the impact of the cancer can be
just as devastating to the patient and their family, Markman said. </p>

<p>Being able to target rare cancers more
affordably and create treatments based on those advanced detection methods may
mean that more people with rare cancers will receive treatments as effective as
treatments used to battle more common types of the disease. </p>

<p>DeSantis noted that a cancer diagnosis is
always a challenge ? regardless of the type. </p>

<p>?But diagnosis with a rare cancer presents
additional challenges which may include difficulties and delays in diagnosis,
more limited treatment options, and a general lack of information and support,?
she noted.</p>

<p>Recent
breakthroughs include a trial that improved three-year survival rates for 23
percent of bile duct cancer patients who took the medicine <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2017-05-17-drug-improves-survival-of-patients-with-rare-cancer-by-almost-a-quarter" target="_blank">capecitabine</a> after surgery. Another study
used <a href="http://www.cancernetwork.com/asco-lung-cancer/immunotherapy-yields-dramatic-response-rates-relapsed-mesothelioma" target="_blank">immunotherapy</a> to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which is a rare cancer linked to
asbestos exposure.</p>

<p>These
are the types of developments that give Markman hope for treating rare cancers.</p>

<p>?For those tumors and those patients and
those patients? families, this is an incredible ray of hope,? Markman said.
?It?s potentially revolutionary in how we begin to view cancer.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-12T12:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-12T12:00:00</updateddate><category>Cancer</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-rare-cancers-on-the-rise</guid><dc:date>2017-06-12T12:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Rich People Are Drinking More</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/rich-people-drinking-more </link><description><![CDATA[<p>More money,
more alcohol.</p>

<p>That?s the
conclusion of researchers who recently studied the drinking habits of people in
Europe.</p>

<p>The results
of a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170511095038.htm" target="_blank">survey</a> made it clear that people in Britain, Ireland, and Portugal
drink more alcohol than citizens of the other European nations.</p>

<p>The survey
results also validated the existence of a correlation between socioeconomic
status and drinking habits.</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that people with more money drink more than
people with less money.</p>

<p>The same appears
to be true in the United States.</p>

<p>Medical
professionals here say they have long understood that higher incomes correspond
to more drinking ? though not necessarily more alcohol-related health problems.</p>



<h2>Why rich
people drink more</h2>

<p>The
relationship between income and drinking is somewhat nuanced, along with factors
such as level of education.</p>

<p>?As income
and education go up, the percentage of people drinking goes up,? Aaron White, PhD,
senior scientific advisor to the director of the <a href="https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a><em>, </em>told
Healthline. ?People that make more money are more likely to drink more, and
more of them binge drink ? or cross the four to five drink threshold ? than
people at lower incomes.?</p>

<p>The likeliest explanation for this association
is accessibility.</p>

<p>?Access is the key factor,? White said.</p>

<p>For starters, wealthier people are likelier to
live in metropolitan areas where bars and restaurants serving alcohol are
concentrated.</p>

<p>?If you have money and you live near outlets
that serve alcohol, you have more access. As access goes up, people drink more.
As prices go down, people drink more,? White said. </p>

<p>Though
paying more for drinks may not appeal to everyone, it would significantly drive
down drinking rates.</p>

<p>?Dozens of
studies have strongly suggested that, as price goes up, consumption goes down,?
White says. ?Where there are drink specials, there is heavier drinking ? and
more drinking and driving.?</p>

<p>?If the cost
of alcohol were to increase, either by taxes or supply and demand, the harms
associated with consumption would decrease.? </p>



<h2>The health
effects</h2>

<p>And yet,
while wealthier people have a higher chance of mild alcohol use disorder (AUD),
they are less likely than people with lower incomes to have serious or severe
AUD ? what?s generally identified as true alcoholism.</p>

<p>?People with
severe AUD can?t quit, can?t cut down, and can?t control their drinking,? White
explained.</p>

<p>Still,
causation is not always clear. Someone with alcohol dependency may lose their
job because of overdrinking and will then incur the economic consequences.</p>

<p>?You may
have been wealthy, but your alcohol abuse disorder may push you into a lower
income bracket,? White said.</p>

<p>Lower income is associated with higher
incidence of <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15278115.Poverty_increases_alcohol_harm__Glasgow_University_study_finds/" target="_blank">alcohol-related conditions</a> like cirrhosis.</p>

<p>Factors such
as mental illness including depression, the strains and stresses of poverty,
and trauma also contribute to excessive drinking ? which in turn exacerbates
the same underlying issues. </p>

<p>?Not
everyone drinks alcohol because they like the way it feels,? White said. ?Some
people drink because their lives are hard and they?re doing what they need to
do to cope. A lot of people drink to feel less bad.?</p>

<p>Higher
income may also mitigate the risks of drinking, explaining why people with
lower incomes who drink are more affected.</p>

<p>Someone who
drinks heavily can afford to spend money on their health, and will be likelier
to avoid some of the risks associated with alcohol use.</p>

<p>?If you see
a doctor, you can learn about cirrhosis,? said White. ?If you buy vegetables,
you?re going to replenish the vitamins that alcohol is depleting. You can go to,
or have a gym. You might go to a therapist.? </p>

<p>?More money
may bring more alcohol intake, but you?re also going to have access to
resources that could mitigate the effects of alcohol,? White added. ?Money
can?t buy you happiness, but it can buy you access to some of the resources
that can offset the adverse effects of heavy drinking.?</p>

some women are taking immediate action before they go home in order to prevent
another pregnancy. </p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2017/05001/Patient_Preferences_About_Immediate_Postpartum.226.aspx" target="_blank">study</a>
by the University of Michigan, published in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, the
rate of IUDs or implants given to women right after childbirth increased from
1.86 per 10,000 deliveries in 2008, to 13.5 per 10,000 deliveries in 2013.</p>

<p>?Increased use of LARC [long-acting
reversible contraception] reduces unintended pregnancies, increases the spacing
between pregnancies, and therefore reduces adverse birth outcomes for mom and
baby,? Dr. Ann E. Borders, told Healthline. </p>

<p>Borders, who authored The American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion on the topic,
added that LARC gives women more reliable family planning with fewer side
effects compared with other birth control methods. Additionally, women with
LARC have high satisfaction and a higher rate of still using the same method of
birth control a year after starting compared with other contraceptive options. </p>

<p>?Methods such as the pill, patch,
or Depo [Depo-Provera] shot rely on ongoing vigilance daily, weekly, or every
three months, with multiple potential barriers to perfect use that could lead
to an unexpected pregnancy,? said Borders.</p>

<p>Receiving LARC in the hospital
safeguards women from future pregnancies if they don't make it to their 6-week
postpartum visit with their doctor, which is typically recommended after giving
birth.</p>

<p>?[Immediate postpartum LARC] is
essential to providing adequate contraception for patients with poor or unreliable
insurance, poor access to care, or poor compliance for a variety of reasons,?
Dr. Jill Placek, an OB-GYN in Illinois, told Healthline. </p>

<p>Not all women follow up with a
postpartum visit, and not all providers offer IUDs or implants at postpartum
visits. Some providers ask patients to return for an additional visit or refer
them to another provider. </p>

<p>?Unfortunately, it is often the
same high-risk population who does not follow up to these visits who are often
at risk of unintended pregnancy in the future. For compliant patients, it is a
plus to not have to make a special trip back to the doctor's office to get
contraception after delivery, however, these patients are usually compliant
with their postpartum visit anyway,? Placek said.</p>

<p>Borders added that the postpartum
period is a challenging time for most women. ?Women are focused on their
newborn and unfortunately their own healthcare may not be a high priority. By
providing women access to LARC methods before they leave the hospital, women
can go home to focus on their newborn knowing they have a plan in place to have
control of when, or if, they want to plan another pregnancy,? she said.</p>



<h2>Not accessible to everyone</h2>

<p>Despite the benefits of LARCs given
immediately after giving birth, the University of Michigan study found about 96
percent of inpatient postpartum IUDs are given to women at urban teaching
hospitals. Women who received implants postpartum in these hospitals tended to have
lower incomes and be less healthy. Moreover, 15 percent of these inpatient
postpartum IUDs are given to women without insurance.</p>

<p>According to Placek, private
practitioners in suburban hospitals like the one she works at are not routinely
putting in LARCs right after a baby is born. However, her hospital recently
responded to requests for stocking IUDs, and they are accessible to patients if
a physician orders them.</p>

<p>Women who give birth in
religious-affiliated hospitals may not have access to immediate postpartum
contraception. So was the case at the Catholic-affiliated hospital where Placek
completed her residency. </p>

<p>?I had to sign that I would abide
by a document from the Archdiocese. IUD or implant placement was not permitted
on hospital premises without extensive approval often requiring additional
indication for use other than contraception. Patients would be counseled on
contraceptive options and alternate arrangements were made for access to their
desired contraceptive needs,? Placek said.</p>



<h2>Risks of immediate placement</h2>

<p>Inserting IUDs postpartum can cause
expulsion and perforation due to the fact that the uterus is big and soft, and
bleeding occurs. The string that is attached to the IUD can get lost in the
uterus, which may require X-rays and surgery to remove it.</p>

<p>For these reasons, some doctors
recommend placement of an IUD at the 6-week postpartum visit or later. Placek
said this makes sense for the majority of her patients who are compliant with
abstinence or using other forms of birth control during this time. </p>

<p>Waiting to place an IUD after the
postpartum visit also allows patients to think about their contraceptive
options for a time, and see what their new life is like at home with a baby or
another child, and how contraception fits in.</p>

<p>However, ?If I have a patient who I
am concerned about compliance and who strongly desires IUD placement
immediately postpartum, I would absolutely provide those services with risks
and benefits counseling,? Placek noted.</p>

<p>While LARC methods are not right
for every woman, Borders stressed it is important that women are educated about
their options. She noted The CHOICE Project, which recruited about 10,000 women
between 2008 and 2011, found that women who had been counseled regarding
contraception options and had financial barriers removed chose LARC methods 75
percent of the time.</p>

<p>She added that an organized effort
to implement and improve access to immediate postpartum LARC placement across
birthing hospitals is needed.</p>

<p>?Urban teaching hospitals have
likely led the way on providing access to immediate postpartum LARC, and rural
and urban nonteaching hospitals may be lagging,? Borders said. ?But regardless
of the type of hospital or location, it will take provider and nursing
champions, with support from administration, pharmacy, billing, to all come
together to put together protocols and procedures in addition to the needed
focus on patient and provider education.?</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-12T06:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-12T06:00:00</updateddate><category>Women's Health</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/more-new-mothers-asking-for-birth-control</guid><dc:date>2017-06-12T06:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Is CRISPR Gene Editing Moving Ahead Too Quickly?</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-crispr-gene-editing-moving-ahead-too-quickly </link><description><![CDATA[<p>CRISPR gene editing
technology has tantalized the public with its potential to cure disease.</p>

<p>However, new
research suggests it could be more dangerous and less precise than previously
believed.</p>

<p>CRISPR-Cas9 was
discovered in 2012 by University of California molecular biologist Jennifer
Doudna and her colleagues. It allows for genetic ?editing? by snipping out
small bits of defective or harmful DNA and replacing it. </p>

<p>Gene editing
has existed since the 1970s, but CRISPR-Cas9 has reinvented it as a precise,
accessible technology.</p>

<p>The
potential applications seem almost limitless.</p>

<p>This year,
Dr. Edze Westra of the University of Exeter, told the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/cancer-inherited-disease-dna-crispr-gene-genome-edze-westra-exeter-university-a7584111.html" target="_blank">Independent</a> that he expects the technology to be ?used to cure all inherited
diseases, to cure cancers, to restore sight to people by transplanting genes.?</p>




<h2>Promises and problems</h2>

<p>Still in its
infancy, CRISPR-Cas9 has yet to deliver on these promises, in humans anyway.</p>

<p>One of the
key talking points of CRISPR-Cas9 has been its precision ? its ability to
accurately edit small sections of DNA without affecting nearby sections.</p>

<p>However, a
new <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n6/full/nmeth.4293.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_biotechnology" target="_blank">study</a> from Columbia University says that CRISPR-Cas9 can introduce
hundreds of unexpected mutations into the genome beyond what was intended. </p>

<p>?We feel
it?s critical that the scientific community consider the potential hazards of
all off-target mutations caused by CRISPR,? said co-author Dr. Stephen Tsang, a
professor at Columbia University Medical Center, in a <a href="http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2017/05/30/crispr-gene-editing-can-cause-hundreds-of-unintended-mutations/" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Tsang and
his team discovered the mutations while conducting research on mice, using
CRISPR-Cas9 to correct a gene that caused blindness.</p>

<p>The
technology worked effectively in curing the blindness, but when the researchers
later looked at the genome of the mice, they said they found additional,
unintended mutations.</p>

<p>Despite
this, the mice appeared to be in fine health.</p>

<p>?We did not
see any observable complications in the mice, despite having all these extra CRISPR-related
mutations,? Tsang told Healthline.</p>

<p>Sheila
Jasanoff, professor of science and technology studies at Harvard University, told
Healthline that ?precision? can have a slippery definition in biotechnology.</p>

<p>?Genetic
engineering was also sold some 40 years ago as a highly precise technique. Now,
CRISPR is being heralded as even more precise,? she said.</p>

<p>?Undoubtedly,
there is some truth in that claim ... But we also know from older genetic
engineering techniques that very precise interventions into one part of a
genome can produce unexpected side effects ? or off-target impacts ? that
scientists were not expecting,? Jasanoff added.</p>




<h2>Risk vs. reward</h2>

<p>Tsang frames
the message of his research in two ways.</p>

<p>First, he
hopes that his work will bring a newfound awareness to the potential side
effects caused by CRISPR. </p>

<p>Although the
mutations he and his team observed did not appear to have any malignant
effects, they should be a wake-up call for researchers.</p>

<p>Secondly,
Tsang says that no matter what kind of medicine or treatment is being used,
there is the potential for side effects.</p>

<p>?If we apply
CRISPR, it?s just like any other intervention medicine. There is always
off-targeting and risks and benefits,? he says.</p>

<p>Jasanoff is
more tempered in her assessment of the risk vs. reward of CRISPR.</p>

<p>?The
assumption that there are untold benefits in store ? long before the work has
been done to establish how a new technology actually will have an impact on any
disease ? is a typical example of the hype that surrounds new and emerging
technologies,? she said.</p>

<p>Tsang?s
research offers no hard answers to the larger questions of efficacy, risk, and
benefit of using CRISPR on humans.</p>

<p>?Let?s not
go overboard,? said Pete Shanks, a consultant who is an expert on genetics. ?Three
blind mice don?t prove much.?</p>

<p>Tsang?s
research does provide some cautionary insight into how research must be
conducted in order to make the technology safer.</p>

<p>Currently
most studies of off-target mutations depend on computer algorithms to locate
and examine affected areas. Tsang and his team say that this isn?t sufficient
when using live specimens.</p>

<p>?These
predictive algorithms seem to do a good job when CRISPR is performed in cells
or tissues in a dish, but whole genome sequencing has not been employed to look
for all off-target effects in living animals,? Alexander Bassuk, professor of
pediatrics at the University of Iowa, and co-author of the study, said in a
press release.</p>

<p>?Researchers
who aren?t using whole genome sequencing to find off-target effects may be
missing potentially important mutations,? Tsang said. </p>




<h2>CRISPR moving ahead rapidly</h2>

<p>This study
comes at an important time.</p>

<p>China has
begun its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-pushes-ahead-with-human-gene-trials-1493380057" target="_blank">first round</a> of human testing using CRISPR-Cas9.</p>

<p>The United
States is due to start its own tests next year.</p>

<p>The research
field is moving quickly ? perhaps too quickly.</p>

<p>?We hope our findings will
encourage others to use whole genome sequencing as a method to determine all
the off-target effects of their CRISPR techniques and study different versions
for the safest, most accurate editing,? Tsang said.</p>

<p>Jasanoff is
much blunter.</p>

<p>?We should
put aside the notion the benefits of CRISPR are already proven, and all we need
to worry about is risks,? she said.</p>]]></description><pubdate>2017-06-11T06:00:00</pubdate><updateddate>2017-06-11T06:00:00</updateddate><category>Technology</category><guid>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-crispr-gene-editing-moving-ahead-too-quickly</guid><dc:date>2017-06-11T06:00:00</dc:date></item><item><title>Electrical Stimulation May Help MS Patients Who Can?t Walk</title><link>http://www.healthline.com/health-news/electrical-stimulation-may-help-ms-patients-walk </link><description><![CDATA[<p>A treatment option that seemed to give false hope 30 years
ago is now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28151761" target="_blank">showing
potential</a> for people with <a href="/health/multiple-sclerosis">multiple sclerosis
(MS)</a> who can no longer walk. </p>

<p>When the movie ?<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089147/" target="_blank">First Steps</a>?came out in 1985 medical <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/arts/researchers-criticize-cbs-film-first-steps.html" target="_blank">experts
scoffed</a> at its message ? that electrical stimulation was a viable
option for helping people to walk again after traumatic spinal cord injuries.</p>

<p>Today experts are successfully providing functional
electrical stimulation for spinal cord patients.</p>

<p>And just recently extended its use to the world of MS.</p>




<h2>How stimulation treatment works</h2>

<p>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a treatment that uses
small electrical charges to improve mobility for someone who has difficulties with
walking caused by damage to the brain or spinal cord. </p>

<p>FES stimulates the nerves in the leg, causing the muscles to
contract and produce a movement that can aid in walking. Currently with MS, the
most common use of FES is as a treatment for foot drop. </p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Selkirk, a neurologist at the Louis Stokes Cleveland
VA Medical Center, told Healthline that FES may not work for everyone.</p>

<p>He said in order for FES to work it is important that nerve
fibers between the spinal cord and the muscles are not damaged.</p>

<p>There are cases where the damage is too extensive for treatment
to work. While this is true in traumatic spinal cord injuries, it may not be an
issue for people with MS.</p>




<h2>Adapting device for MS treatment</h2>

<p>After seeing success with FES for people with traumatic
spinal cord injuries, Selkirk suggested using it for people with MS.</p>

<p>So, in partnership with the <a href="https://www.aptcenter.research.va.gov/" target="_blank">Advanced Platform
Technology (APT)</a> Center, a new device was created specifically for these
people.</p>

<p>This new device is the size of a hockey puck and is inserted
into the abdomen cavity, similar to <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/intrathecal-baclofen-therapy-for-ms" target="_blank">baclofen
pumps</a> used to treat muscle spasticity in people with MS. </p>

<p>Selkirk specializes in spinal cord injuries and works with people
who have MS and <a href="/health/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis">amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS)</a> who can no longer
walk.</p>

<p>In his work at Veterans Affairs (VA), Selkirk sees some 300 people
with MS, 100 of whom can no longer walk. </p>

<p>?There has been a long battle to find funding,? said
Selkirk, adding that different grant applications were submitted 11 times but
never approved.</p>

<p>But then APT approved it and found success, yet there is
concern about the market size of people with MS who could benefit from these
devices.</p>

<p>Approximately 2.5 million people worldwide have MS, and of
those some 30 percent have difficulties with walking and can end up using a
wheelchair.</p>




<h2>What devices are available</h2>

<p>Currently, there are several FES devices available to people
with MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society <a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Rehabilitation/Functional-Electrical-Stimulation-(FES)" target="_blank">website</a>.
</p>

<p>At a price tag of around $5,000, the WalkAide from Innovative
Neurotronics, the NESS L300 from Bioness, and the Odstock Dropped Foot
Stimulator from Odstock Medical Limited in the United Kingdom, are available
over the counter. </p>

<p>These devices only work with the ankle and knee and not the
entire leg, which make them good for foot drop, but not as successful for those
needing more help walking.</p>

<p>Doctors also prescribe <a href="/drugs/dalfampridine/oral-tablet">Ampyra</a>,
a prescription drug designed to help with walking, but it is only effective in
about 30 percent of those who?ve taken it.</p>

<p>The new, implanted FES works by bypassing the demyelinated
axons and allowing the ?box? to communicate directly with the nerves, telling
them to send a signal to a muscle.</p>

<p>Electrodes are implanted under
the skin at the sites of the affected muscles and can easily be adjusted
according to progression. </p>

<p>However, the peer reviews don?t see it this way. ?They see a
fixed system,? making it difficult to get funding for further studies. </p>

<p>Selkirk debunked a couple of other concerns.</p>

<p>It is generally OK for people with MS to undergo the surgery
necessary for the implantation, he said.</p>

<p>The other concern is in MRI compatibility. Earlier devices
did not work with this technology, but a new MRI compatible device is currently
being tested. </p>




<h2>What the future holds</h2>

<p>The next step is to prove MRI compatibility in the next iteration
of the device, then implant it in the next group of people.</p>

<p>Selkirk has plenty of volunteers ? people with MS willing to
try just about anything to find an improved quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>While the device being tested right now requires someone to
turn it on and control it, the goal is to have the brain communicate this
information to the device directly.</p>

<p>Selkirk is currently working with <a href="https://www.braingate.org/clinical-trials/" target="_blank">Braingate</a>
to create a brain-computer interface.</p>

<p>?This is the future. An implanted system where you bypass
the broken part with technology that is integrated, and all you need to do is
think ?move my left leg? and it will happen,? he said. </p>

<p>?Key thing to consider is perspective.? Selkirk said. ?In
the private sector doctors see various levels of MS. I only see advanced MS
patients.? </p>

<p>He knows what is important to people with MS, such as
quality of life. </p>

<p>Even just the ability to stand up, to transfer to the
commode or wheelchair is improvement in quality of life.</p>

<p>To be independent and spontaneous along with the physical
benefits such as alleviating pressure wounds and sores could benefit many.</p><p><em style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; box-sizing: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Editor?s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.
